0,Flat Kerouac,"I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.","I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading.

1,A good introduction to the tragedies.,"Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.","Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare.

0,Stick with Sleeping Beauty,"Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)","Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree.

1,This Book Changed My Life,"Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing. I personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through. I couldn't put it down, it simple spoke to me. Rules to follow while reading this: 1.) Pay attention and savor, and 2.) Open your mind","Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing.

0,Still a Mystery,"Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book. This book, in fact, does not examine anything of intellectual, spiritual, or social value as related to Sufism or Islam. I have come across many books written by so-called Sufi Masters, who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery. This is not one of them. While books in this genre easily turn into polemics, this one surely takes the unenlightened cake. The stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an 'easy way out' of organizing a coherent book of ideology.","Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book.

1,THE MUSIC IS BACK !!,"People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the ""Measure of a Man"" CD. The crystal clearness, unspoiled beauty, perfect pitch, and power of Clay Aiken's voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase. I am so impressed with this CD and, as much as I love each song, I'm blown away by ""Perfect Day"".","People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the Measure of a Man CD.

1,"This book is wild, wonderful, blatantly honest and necessary","If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did.","If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one.

1,Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better,"Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and ""Travels With Charley"" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight.","Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part.

1,Awesome drum for a crappy drummer.,"This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box, a classic, beautiful design. I swapped the stock Weather Master heads for an Emperor Coated/ Clear Ambassador Reso. Also swapped stock snares for 42-strand wires. No complaints about sound from this beauty.My only complaint to date is the strainer. The standard P-85 strainer would often get snagged when moving the snares from off to on. This sucks big time when you're in the middle of a song, fighting with the strainer to co-operate. I got desperate and almost snapped the arm off it once. This may have been a problem on my end, seating it incorrectly or something. I'll soon swap to a P-86 strainer.Also, watch out for fingerprints on this! The chrome looks awesome when it's clean, however fingerprints really stand out.. and drive me mad. Minor detail but thought it was worth mentioning.Overall, very good drum. If mine got stolen or destroyed in a fire I would buy another.","This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box, a classic, beautiful design.

1,History Brought to Life,"This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family.","This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family.

1,LOve it!,"I have really curly, thich & frizzy hair. I found this product @ a local beauty supply store and LOVE it!!! I now have soft, flowing, shiny, beautiful curls. I used to need mousse, curl enhancers and tons of products to wear my curls. Since I started using this product I can just spray some leave in conditioner and I am good to walk out the door :) I usually apply it 2-3x's a wk over night and just rinse out in the morn (no shampoo).","I have really curly, thich  frizzy hair.

1,Houseboat,"This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper, Loren helps Grant to change his priorities, be less of a jerk, and bond with his children. This takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river. Grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch. Loren is the Italian beauty (thought she was ugly when I was a child)that falls in love with Grant and brings the family together.","This movie is a real delight.

1,Faith in this Movie,"Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom ""Dharma and Greg""), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike.","Nortan Fight Club American History X, Elfman Sitcom Dharma and Greg, and Stiller Meet the Parents light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives.

1,Chilling!,"I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved ""The Night"" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of ""Morphine's"" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply ""Chilling"". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: ""Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?"" Thank you Mark...for the beauty.","I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while.

1,"Good, but sometimes disturbing","THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as ""Last house on the left"". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think ""Scream"" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a ""good"" movie. But, if ya think ""that"" movie contains the same if not ""equal"" shock value, you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen{ from such a fine director}.The acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious.The makeup is incredibly real, so that if it had been done in black and white, the film would have been just as effective. And the camerawork, nothing less than brilliant. It's up there with ""Psycho"" the original [Hitchcock] as well as the remake [Gus Van Sandt] This is real Hideyoureyes terror.Made to be ""Watched Alone"" in the dark.In the daylight as well.Beware the Meathook","THIS is a HORROR movie.

0,"Breathtaking cinematography, invasive music, 1 hour too long","One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves.","One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years.

1,Struggles with Faith,"There's no getting around it: regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker. Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release Redemption's Son. Though his belief runs deep, the thrill in his work is that his faith doesn't come without continuous struggle. Like his idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, his music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps his progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor. The title cut, ""Dear Lord"", ""Evidence"" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the end doesn't nullify the journey.","There's no getting around it regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker.

0,It tries and tries...,"Get a big cauldron. Next, drop in Blade Runner, Laura Croft and Krull. Mix haphazardly.

The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are ghastly (not in a good way); It looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors.This is a B-movie, and a poor example to-boot. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high. While not worth the $4 it cost on Amazon, it might be worth $1 on 'RedBox'; but they were too smart to include it in their lineup.","Get a big cauldron.

1,A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World,"If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice, music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that I can not find the words to describe. How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for ""It's in the Rain"" for me. I have said what I have tried to put into words. I just love her music.","If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya.

1,last recordng by the best sax player of his generation,"The best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever. This is Getz last recording, and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad. His lyrical inventiveness was never greater though. Getz doesn't embellish the original melody in his solos. He makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty. Here they are often plaintive and full of pain. Jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess. But Getz's technnical skills and Romantic imagination turn all this into high art. Barron, of course, is simply the best jazz pianist around. Together they have produced a truly great album.","The best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever.

1,No one did it better,"In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable.","In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century.

You will need to nuke 2 or 3 bags of popcorn prior to the movie, you will be too captivated to get up for food let alone to pause the film.","Ben Hur, Spartacus, even the ever tantilizing Roma...no other film of the Roman Epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in Gladiator.

1,Romance and Laughs Abound!,"I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic ""Beauty and The Beast"" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most ""wounded"" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!",I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it.

0,K-KRAP,"On the one hand, you've got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike (Don Juan DeMarco; Cuckoo's Nest). On the other hand, you've got the Taoist alien dispensing generic new-age advice (Starman). Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake. This movie was way too long, way too slow, too self-involved and overall just dull. Kevin Spacey has done some fantastic work (Seven; American Beauty; Usual Suspects) but this is isn't it. Also, someone said the ending was ambiguous. Not true. Prot is Robert Porter.","On the one hand, you've got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike Don Juan DeMarco Cuckoo's Nest.

0,My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion,"I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!","I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand.

1,Spectacular!,"Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.","Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show.

1,Perfect.,"This movie was WITTY, HILARIOUS, SEXY, and just WELL *DONE*!After seeing terrible movies like Beauty Shop which shamelessly and hypocritically use and abuse racial stereotypes, I was apprehensive about seeing a movie about interracial dating....I was so *more* than pleasantly surprised with ""Something New.""Sanaa Lathan hits the comedic notes perfectly and Simon Baker is a refreshing (and beautiful) face on the screen. Though it follows the general formula of any romance comedy, it definitely has a unique edge.

1,Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it,"Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue. This book really gave me new insight and a different way of thinking about the frozen tundra I really don't know a whole lot about, and made me appreciate its beauty in a new way and understand the importance of the landscape.","Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it.

1,A Horror Treat for the Spooky season,"A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts, murders, and tales of illicit lust. In his first film, James Fessenden has woven classic chilling elements to create a terror tapestry of cold-hearted malice. Things are seldom what they seem, and there is no room for security in a world that only seems to be tranquil and quiet. As an independent film, it should be judged by its sinister spirit and not by the production values. This is a film that deserves to be watched on a cold autumn night when the wind rattles the house and creaking boards add to the atmosphere. See it with someone you want to freak out!","A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult.

1,no title,"From the producers of ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic.","From the producers of The Terminator and Aliens and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem.

0,Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie,"Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why), but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress. While suspenseful, the movie is ultimately infuriating because like another recent French release,Cache (Hidden), not only is the viewer unable to figure it out, turns out the actors are unclear on the concept as well. Indeed, in the ""Making Of"" featurette included on the DVD, Ms. Devos literally shrugs her shoulders and admits to giving up on figuring out the movie and simply focusing on her role. Moreover, director Emmanuel Carrère and writer Jérme Beaujour tell featurette viewers that they reviewed the first cut of the film and realized that they needed to chop out the explanatory scene (hopefully the one that lets on whether it's the wife or the husband that's gone off the deep end). Maddening.","Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here seeRead My Lipsto understand why, but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress.

1,Freaks,"Even people jaded by the extreme ""realism"" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.","Even people jaded by the extreme realism of the 21st century will be shocked by this one.

She looks nothing like the Kidman I know today, December 22nd, 2004. What did she do to her face? Botox? Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat. THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film. The faded blonde hair of late, the flat eyebrows and expressionless brow take the uncommon beauty out of her.I gave this movie two stars for Mel Harris, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Kidman.

1,Strong Characters in On Beauty,"Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty. I read White Teeth right before Beauty to get a grasp of the writer. In my opinion, Smith is much more focused on character development-where as the plot can sometimes become slow or irrelevant. She takes her time to develop each character with their flaws and curious qualities. I guess that it why it took me so long to understand or even care when Howard was discussed as a character. However, take the time to keep reading and you will see how he develops along with his family and colleaguesEven though the book can be ""adjective heavy"" with the plot, I still found it enjoyable and related to my college experiences with all types of students. Read On Beauty for what Smith does best---become invested with the characters.","Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty.

0,Huge disappointment,"Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited. However, I thought this book did not deserve any of the accolades heaped upon it. Her metaphors are way over used, and some of them just made no sense. Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn't know what she meant then either. Physical descriptions of characters left me picturing that everyone was one of Van Gogh's Potato Eaters, and I couldn't see why, in this book focused on love and relationships, anyone was with anyone for anything. It is said that writers should write about what they know. Based on her descriptions of anything American, I was surprised to learn that she had been in the country even once. She needed more research and a better editor. What's weird though is that I could see she was talented. But after this there is no way I want to try White Teeth. I don't trust her to not make me mad with these elements again.","Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited.

Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later.

Next time, the publisher should spend a couple of extra bucks and put in a few more pictures for us dummies out there who are not as knowledgeable as Hoving.

1,The Unthinking Brilliance Of A Casual Genuis,"Most people will be put off by Mos Def's new album on the basis that it's different from the norm and what they are used to listening. I have read reviews treating it as Hip-hop and reviews treating it as rock. I've yet to read one that views it as I do as an eclectic amalgamation of all forms of music that are dear to the artist. This album is Mos's own; it's selfishly his own. Yet some of the tracks appear to be put together so casually that it is all you can do to listen and revel in the sheer brilliance of such haphazard beauty. I would Mos Def recommend this to all lovers of music, if however you constrain yourself based on genre, you should be careful. This album makes 'The Love Below' seem like a cynical commercial cash in.","Most people will be put off by Mos Def's new album on the basis that it's different from the norm and what they are used to listening.

1,Drifting Away,"The drifting music ofLaura (Fox Film Noir)melts us into the portrait of a murdered beauty. We are infatuated.

Laura is cool and ravishing.After all though, I was subdued by Clifton Web, as the splendidly audacious Waldo Lydecker. His words are choice and sautéed in lemon juice; a wonderful contrast to Laura. I must agree with him, when gum-chewing Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson has become infatuated with the portrait of Laura, he sneers ""Have you ever dreamed of Laura as you wife, sitting by your side at the policeman's ball or in the bleachers... or listening to the heroic story of how you got a silver shinbone from a battle with a gangster?

1,This DVD is tropical HOT with crankin' music,I bought Hip Hop Bad Girls Brazil. This DVD is AWESOME!!!. The women have glorius rear ends and there are butts-a-plenty.

Their second cd (Beauty In The Broken) is not quite as good although has a few songs that get a 10 out of 10. This cd though, I can say it's still in my cd player a few times a week and I never grow tired of hearing all the songs over and over. On a side note, the guys are awesome to hang out with and really do have a love for Jesus and their fans.

0,horrible translation,"i am a muslim myself. I have read the 'real' Koran several times and have much of it memorized. Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated, that its that unique. Well now i know they have a point. It's like a translation of a fine work of poetry. It simply can not capture the true beauty or depth of the Koran. I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says. I would love the rest of the world to read and understand the beauty of the Koran, but so far, the only way to do do is to read it in its original text.","i am a muslim myself.

1,An appropriately thought-provoking read for any age,"The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain. Not only is the story epic and brief, making it perfect for younger or simply impatient readers; but it is beautifully crafted. As you move from one line to the next, you will find it hard to foresee whether the next feeling it stirs within you will be shock, awe, comfort, disgust, and so on. This is a daring little story, aimed at the big enemy we could prove to be for ourselves. Buy one for everyone you know who isn't afraid to face the darkness with both eyes open!","The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain.

0,Rambling and Naive,"Caveat is I usually don't read this kind of fluff, but I enjoy it when it's good. The premise of the book set forth in the first 2 chapters is interesting and inspiring - simplicity and power equals beauty - an objective concept when applied to machines. In Chapter 3 Gelertner digresses to a lenghty and naive discussion of the Apple desktop suggesting the reason that Microsoft won is that Americans don't recognize beauty until they are beat over the head with it. He continues to ramble with some unformed ravings on interface and computer cabinet design and peters out from there. Book design and illustrations are appalling considering the subject of the book. Reminds me of the papers I used to write in college on the night before they were due.","Caveat is I usually don't read this kind of fluff, but I enjoy it when it's good.

More in-line with the literary tradition of the English language, Lawrence Ferlinghetti thankfully lacks Ginsberg's heavy-handedness and Kerouac's understated moodiness -- there is something buoyant even in Ferlinghetti's most wrenching laments; we always seem to learn something from him (and if we don't, he's willing to laugh it all away with us). Ferlinghetti's knowledge of art and history (and his ability to tie them into his themes), as well as an unusual matter-of-fact (often in medias res) presentation lends an aura of significance to what could otherwise be random musings.

1,beauty in simplicity,"I've been a long-time lover of artists who write their own lyrics, sing their own songs without digital editing, and play their own instruments. Toby is a near-perfect exemplar of this ideal. Her rich alto ranges from sweet and soft to sultry and dark but she is never less than delicious. Her versatility is brought to the fore with the range of laid-back grooves and expressive inflections. This album's only shortcoming is the over-production of a couple tracks. By and large, the best stuff is the simplest and Toby gets to truly shine in ""coming back in"" and ""Everyday."" Her lyrics are accessible to all of us as she writes about relationships, fighting with herself, and being fascinated by her own singing idol. ""Little Things"" is a great album that has joined the ranks of Ari Hest for the sheer beauty of the entire project.","I've been a long-time lover of artists who write their own lyrics, sing their own songs without digital editing, and play their own instruments.

0,worth a look,"Although one hesitates to give any book by D. H. Lawrence two stars, in this case I must. The Plumed Serpent is no Son's and Lovers. This late Lawrence book is filled with long-winded, pretentious and repetitive passages of ersatz Aztec religious claptrap and equally ill-conceived mysticism about the savage Mexican Indian as a race. Couple these with a sort of proto-fascism, and one has a pretty nasty book. Lawrence's take on gender relations in this world of neo-Aztec revival is equally unattractive. At the same time, there are the descriptive passages of great lyric beauty that are pure Lawrence and some earnest wrestling with questions of individualism versus the commonality of humankind. I didn't like the book, but I'm glad I read it.","Although one hesitates to give any book by D. H. Lawrence two stars, in this case I must. The Plumed Serpent is no Son's and Lovers.

This becomes very tiring and is not a believable makeup of his characters. The right-wingers are the saviors, anybody else is a cold, bloodthirsty lunatic. How boring. And how often does the reader have to be reminded of what each character's intentions are? Each individual in the book has to repeat how they feel and what they're thinking about three dozen times. In school, this was considered ""fattening"" for length rather than content. The result in RAINBOW SIX is that the story gets continually bogged down.","Clancy's last three books have been very poor.

0,"Too tiny, too thin","This is quite small and is composed mainly of images (painting: details of painting: further details of painting etc.). For me the text was actually the interesting part of the publication; quotes and contemporary commentary and criticism of beauty and fashion pair with each reproduced image to emphasize and explain the fashions shown in the painting to a modern viewer. As interesting as the quotes are, they are the only text in the book and I believe any general art history book would give the reader a far deeper appreciation for the context of the painting. Rather than purchasing this book, look for publications of the pencil drawings and portraits of artistis like Ingres for beautifully rendered contemporary costume.","This is quite small and is composed mainly of images painting details of painting further details of painting etc..

0,The second star is for the production design...,"I was horrified by this remake of William Castle's 1960 film. The characters are weak, the continuity errors are numerous, and I was highly disappointed. A second star went to the production design, however, which was brilliant. The house was well designed, the makeup was good. See the original, unless you're looking for a no-brainer horror film with cheap thrills.","I was horrified by this remake of William Castle's 1960 film.

0,Skip the castles in Spain,"Synopsis from back of book:Love for such a man could lead only to disaster! Beauty and innocence were rare qualities in a woman in the turbulent times of eleventh-century Spain, but Madelon del Rivas y Montevides possessed both. Although desired by many men, she had fallen in love with the dashing Valentin Maratin, the man who had saved her from being sold into slavery but who was a mortal enemy of her beloved brother. Loyalty to her family struggled in her heart with passion, but there was room for only one. And soon she found herself plunged into a world of lies, intrigue . . . and murder.Personal commentary:I found the backdrop of eleventh-century Spain somehow more interesting than the characters. The heroine was ok, I guess --- even her rather blind loyalty to her brother was rather workable --- however, neither she nor any of the other characters really caught my attention. Pass on this one.","Synopsis from back of bookLove for such a man could lead only to disaster!

1,Embrya: His words echo beyond the end of each song,"I really enjoyed Maxwell's: Embrya. Unlike many artists out there, Maxwell seduces his listeners with with poetic words and mellow sounds to bring across his message. I extremly loved ""Submerge: Til We Become the Sun"" because it's not just about having sex but making love and becoming one with your partner. This track seduces the listener to the degree that you don't realize it, until the moment is over. Maxwell has written songs that I can truly admire and respect. It's about time we get back to the beauty of love making and sharing more than just a fleeting moment pleasure. His words truly echo beyond the end of each song.","I really enjoyed Maxwell's Embrya.

1,The best collection of lullabies ever recorded,"Having just put my fussy 15 month old to sleep with this tape (note: it's really not a book on cassette - it's all music), I can vouch not only for its effiency but also for its beauty. This has been my favorite lullaby recording since my own mother played it for me nearly 40 years ago, and the voices of Pete Seeger and Oscar Brand along with several unusually soothing others continue to enthrall me, and now my son. A mix of the familiar (Hush Little Baby, All the Pretty Little Horses)and rarely heard (Go To Bed First, Golden Slumbers) never palls. My only wish is that the cassette liner included the lyrics (my original LP contained a booklet with both lyrics and melody lines). It would be wonderful to have this released on CD. ....","Having just put my fussy 15 month old to sleep with this tape note it's really not a book on cassette - it's all music, I can vouch not only for its effiency but also for its beauty.

0,"Good writing, bad detective","I bought this book because of all the great reviews. But I have to say I was really disappointed with this book. The overall story and character development is good but December Vaughn is an idiot! It was really painful to read this book and how the main character didn't pick up on any of the clues! I would pass on this book. The good writing doesn't makeup for the idiot detective work. If you want a good mystery book read Passion, Betrayal and Killer Highlights by Kyra Davis.","I bought this book because of all the great reviews.

""Jack The Ripper,"" One of Jesus' most well known films, is a test for average film goers. Necrophilia (almost) and really low budget gore make this movie hard for the ""Lord Of The Rings"" viewer to witness. But that fact is the beauty of it all. If you ever watch a Fraco movie it's a badge of honor: ""Hey, that movie was funny as junk, it was awesome."" Jesus Franco's perception of The Ripper is a unique one, making him an insane doctor who treats the less than fortunate Fellow. Warm hearted doctor Luv by day, Cold blooded pscho necrphyliac murderer. Doesn't fit, but is certainly entertaining. Great camp perfornces from Kinski(Jack) and Romay (uh... wife.)","Make no mistake about it, the movie is very poorly made and has laughable acting, but this one is still entertaining.

I was lucky enough to receive the VHS version as a gift 5 years ago, but my copy is starting to lose it's picture quality after to many viewings. I had heard that they were rereleasing it too, but does anyone know when?? The visual beauty of this film would be magnificent in the DVD format. Also, any added materials as were in Vertigo would be fabulous. If anyone hears an exact date of release- please post it here.","This movie is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time.

1,One of the greatest tales of tragic adventure ever lived,"An amazing story of an innocent man's journey from the underworld of France to the underbelly of the penal colony of French Guiana in 1931. The movie, though excellent, pales in comparison to this incredible page turner that any author would be hard pressed to fabricate unless he lived it. Charierre (aka Papillon) sheds light on the beauty and brutality of humanity with touching insight and shrewd instinct. Depicting life and society on the inescapable islands in a straightforward fashion, Papillon paints a colorful, if not surreal, picture with humor and sheer agony. After nine escape attempts, the reader is left wondering how a man could have prevailed. Charierre's auto-biographical adventure is a testament to a good man's astounding mental capacity to survive the most hellish circumstances by his wit, ingenuity and imagination despite the odds of survival. A must read for the soul.","An amazing story of an innocent man's journey from the underworld of France to the underbelly of the penal colony of French Guiana in 1931.

1,An Insightful Interpretation,"I find it amazing that two film makers could produce two such different works based on the same source, and both be so successful. Olivier's and Branaugh's version of Shakespeare's Henry V are both very much of their time. Olivier's was of necessity very much a pro-war piece, while Branaugh had the luxury of emphasizing the horrors of war aspects. The beauty of this is that they both are valid interpretations of Shakespeare's original. I have seen hundreds of productions of Shakespeare in my day, both on stage and in the theater, and this is one of the best. It is definitely the best of Branaugh's adaptations, although I very much liked his Hamlet as well.","I find it amazing that two film makers could produce two such different works based on the same source, and both be so successful.

I can't give it 5 stars, because I can't give an album that is largely a couple of ideas taken ad nauseum 5 stars; however, I will say this: I hear some references to Coltrane's A Love Supreme in this album. It is even more uplifting in some ways than A Love Supreme, if not as influential in its scope.By the way, the LP contains all the music that this CD contains, except that it is continued on side 2.","The beauty of Karma is not the Free Jazz, but rather the repetitive hymnal harmonic chord progression that is uplifting.

1,Bizet's greatest opera?,"OK, maybe not. Having produced Carmen, one of the major theatrical works of the 19th century, The Pearl Fishers will probably never be considered Bizet's greatest work. Yet for sheer sensual beauty, it's hard to think of a work that can rival it. From the famous, knock-out duet for tenor & baritone in the first act to the rousing chorus that ends Act II, and the nostalgic return of the duet in the concluding scene, it's one gorgeous moment to the next. I bought this recording on the strength of other reviews here at Amazon: it's a fine document of a beautiful score.","OK, maybe not.

1,Read This One!,"In some sense VAS picks up where Richard Powers's groundbreaking The Gold Bug Variations leaves off: assume that the structure of language is reflected in the double helix, and assume further that print technologies are an analog for body technologies, words and images and book materials made flesh and blood and bones. Now imagine a narrative orchestrated around characters whose symbolic proportions resonate with the latter two assumptions, and you have some idea of the staggering visual sweep and poetic beauty of VAS, perhaps the first graphic novel (term used advisedly) in which both ""graphic"" and ""novel"" are given their full due as contemporary art forms, thus reinventing the genre while re-novelizing the novel of ideas. VAS stitches personal reproductive drama to social-scientific controversy to illustrate the challenges facing our species, a species wedded to its incorporations. Author Tomasula and designer Farrell have set the bar very, very high.","In some sense VAS picks up where Richard Powers's groundbreaking The Gold Bug Variations leaves off assume that the structure of language is reflected in the double helix, and assume further that print technologies are an analog for body technologies, words and images and book materials made flesh and blood and bones.

After three or four times of using it i end up washing it off my face and squeezing the rest of my old moisturizer out of the tube( Vichy for oily skin ). I would not recomend it to anyone; there are some options out there that are in the same price range but much better quality( vichy is an example).","I purchased this moisturizer at CVS after trying neutrogena Ultra sheer liquid dauly sun protection which, by the way, is amazing.

0,Laughably bad,"I have nothing against modern adaptations of classics, but it is painfully obvious that the cast in R+J had no idea what they were saying, let alone what the story was actually about. Those who praise the film forget that the story itself is a masterpiece, and it's almost impossible to destroy the beauty of it. R+J comes close, though; bad acting and dizzying foolishness at its worst. Stick with the Olivia Hussey version.","I have nothing against modern adaptations of classics, but it is painfully obvious that the cast in RJ had no idea what they were saying, let alone what the story was actually about.

1,magical cinematic expression,"The story of Alec and Black and the strong bond between them was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and it's still a favorite of mine. My favorite scenes from the movie are the ones that occur during the first 45 minutes. The scenes where they're stranded on the island are so magical that I almost feel disappointed when they get rescued. After that, everything becomes much more ordinary: not bad, necessarily, but ordinary. Up until the racing scene, when all the beauty apparent in the island scenes resurfaces. Throughout, the cinematography, production values, and acting are first-rate, and the story has become classic. This is such a great movie, and not just for kids.","The story of Alec and Black and the strong bond between them was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and it's still a favorite of mine.

0,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn't help that I have an oily T-zone. When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it's for oily skin, but I was wrong....so wrong. After about an hour, the makeup ""slides"" off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots. So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it's all clumped. There is no ""smoothing"" it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it's still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I've tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn't cover the redness on my skin. Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly. I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again.","I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn't help that I have an oily T-zone.

1,Rosalind Russell Rules,"Cary Grant is great in HIS GIRL FRIDAY--Cary Grant was great in everything he ever did--but it is Rosalind Russell who makes this film for me. She was an atypical film actress for her day, playing a middle ground between the typical starlet and the tough-gal Betty Davis type. Russell is tough, tart, and totally believeable as Grant's ex, an independent beauty who wants a man but can do without him too.Whadda woman!As for the script, it's one of the wordiest around, quick and clipped, witty and inescapeably sharp. If Charles Lederer wasn't recognized for this screenplay, there was fraud afoot.","Cary Grant is great in HIS GIRL FRIDAY--Cary Grant was great in everything he ever did--but it is Rosalind Russell who makes this film for me.

0,annoying voice of Dexter Gordon.,"Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie. The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow. I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it. Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10. With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius, Tavernier should have chosen an actor with a better voice. Typical french movies, they throw things at you that you must like because it is supposed to be deep and intellectual. Wrong. as Serge Dassault inventor of the Mirage jet fighter once said: "" a plane can be technically the best, but without beauty it isn't a plane.","Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie.

0,Average View of European Countries,"There are some really breathtaking scenes in Sweden,Norway and Finland....they are just mesmerizing!They show sheer natural beauty that is abundant in these countries. However,the effort fails to capture anything about Spain and Portugal at all...there are only passing references to Madrid and Lisbon that might have been a little better. In some places the photography is just high class....but at the same time in other places the camera work is really poor...showing only dark images.This sure doesn't help. In its informational content I feel there is a lot to be desired.It is able to provide only a broader picture...some elaborate descriptions might help. In short,the feature can be rated as average.It could have been presented in a more dramatic fashion.The narration is not very good either.","There are some really breathtaking scenes in Sweden,Norway and Finland....they are just mesmerizing!They show sheer natural beauty that is abundant in these countries.

1,A humble display of a monumental piece,"A truthful and modest account of the Goldberg Variations is presented by American pianist Samuel Bartos. The voicing is crystal clear and his cross-handed work in some movements are flawless. His playing is not ostentatious. In fact, the beauty of this recording lies in its simplicity and humility. Unfortunately the timbre of the instrument is rather faint which robs away the richness that this piece so rightly deserves. No repeats is observed but the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue is an added bonus in this CD.","A truthful and modest account of the Goldberg Variations is presented by American pianist Samuel Bartos.

0,Great disappointment from Great painters series,"Being great Roerich fans and being that there is so precious little available in print, myself and several friends were all bitterly disappointed with this otherwise very promising book. Ken Archer is undoubtedly a Roerich expert and all of our hopes were high. However, precious little information of a more than superficial nature was not forthcoming. Whilst the reproductions are good on the whole, some are reversed or wrongly titled....We had heard of this book many, many years ago and were eagerly anticipating what promised to be a great book on a spiritual artist dedicated to Beauty and to raising the vibrations of humanity through the Creative Fire. I am truly sorry that I cannot advise anybody to expect too much from this book. Far better...is the only other book currently available - by J.

Yes, it has flaws, but they add to its beauty - the overall story has an honesty and quirkiness which really transports the reader.","I just finished reading this book for the second time, I read it about 4 years ago and for some unkown reason i picked it up agian.

1,Milla vs the Zombies - I'd bet on Milla,"It seems that one cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a zombie these days. In this ultra-modern zombie flick, Milla Jovovich plays Alice and takes a train down the rabbit hole to battle human and dog zombies and an evil computer, the Red Queen (off with her head!).This is one of those love-it or hate-it movies. I loved it. This is one of the best game-based movies out there. Sure, the zombie thread is standard fare (a virus causes a zombie plague and a group of people fight to survive), but there are good special effects.The movie is very fast-paced, mindless and filled with action, good sound effects and soundtrack. Not surprisingly, this movie is quite violent and depicts a lot of gore.On the extended DVD, there are some interesting extras. I thought the piece on the makeup for the Zombie Dogs was fun.","It seems that one cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a zombie these days.

1,His first novel and should be yours too,"I have read all of Dickens' novels and found them all to be wonderful. But if I have to recommend a starter Dickens novel to anyone I would definitely choose The Pickwick Papers. There is nothing more enjoyable and it is no wonder that this, his first novel, was an immediate hit. The diverse characters and stories, the humor, the keen observations of humanity, and how everything comes together towards the end are all incomparable characteristics of a Dickens novel. But don't read Dickens like you would read a spy novel.

1,great before and after,"If you are looking for a book that shows you how to do makeup to go to work at your office, this probably isn't the book for you.If you are a beginning makeup professional like myself I find this book helpful. It has two full face size pictures, before makeup on the left and after on the right, with an overlay showing where and what product was used.It is all Nars makeup but the variety out there these days isn't bad and I think you can probably find the same colors in other product lines. (You might have to search a bit.)The graphic design of the book is great. It's a spiral bound hard cover so you can use it without it flopping around while you're working. I would say the detailed pages with light grey text on white is a bit annoying but other than that the desing is practical and useful.","If you are looking for a book that shows you how to do makeup to go to work at your office, this probably isn't the book for you.If you are a beginning makeup professional like myself I find this book helpful.

1,This CD Rocks!,"C'mon C'mon is fantastic! If your a longtime Sheryl fan, or you just like Soak Up The Sun, you'll love this CD. Steve McQueen and Hole in My Pocket are great fun rockers. Over You and Abeliene are more guitar laden and a little less forceful. Lucky Kid is just terrific. And Weather Channel is haunting in it's beauty. I'm not exactly thrilled by It's so easy, but If you like Don Henley, it's the song for you. And It's Only Love is a great new take on a wonderful song. This is a must buy record, hands down.","C'mon C'mon is fantastic! If your a longtime Sheryl fan, or you just like Soak Up The Sun, you'll love this CD.

1,Wonderful!,"I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women. We are a certain way with each other today, and we were the same with each other over two thousand years ago. That is the real beauty of this book for me. I think Anita Diamant did a remarkable job in capturing the essence of life for women B.C. She made me contemplate what it would have been like to not only know the story of Abraham and Issac, but to know both men as family members. To have known Rebecca as a grandmother! My goodness. I am not a Biblical scholar, but she brought this era to life for me. In short, it's a wonderful book and I recommend it highly.","I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women.

0,Listenable but obviously without any major songs,"This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my ""go-to"" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood, at any time. This CD has some well-written songs, but there are only two songs (the first, ""Worms"", and ""Heartlandtruckstop"") that burst out of the speakers the way Beth Orton songs can. The rest are all absolutely listenable but none of the songs has that ""I must replay this song now"" moment.I am used to Beth's songs possessing many random moments of beauty, that are partly caused by the spareness of production. This CD all the songs sound pleasntly even on the EQ band, but they mostly lack the punchy lyrics or compelling music that grabs you. For instance, I heard many of these songs over and over again on the radio, but none stood out the way ""Stolen Car"" did or ""Mt. Washington"" did.Get Daybreaker instead for your Beth Orton space in your record collection.","This CD is a big disappointment.

1,A winner for the heart.,"This movie is spectacular in every way. At the theater I was blown away with the lavishness and constant eye-candy of the sets and scenery. I can hardly wait for the DVD, to help re-create some of the magic of the big screen.I am a lifetime fan of the original musical ""The King and I"" and once even saw Yul Brenner do the stage play in person. A magical experience -- so I went into the theater thinking it might be a poor imitation, but it wasn't! A completely different kind of movie, with a wonderful, believable performance by Chow Yun-Fat, speaking of eye-candy. Jodie Foster brought the passion and bravery of Anna to life -- and though it only contains elements of truth; it is a charming, sometimes breathtaking fantasy worthy of some of the most lavish productions of Hollywood days gone by. If you love beauty, passion, and a rollercoaster ride of laughter to tears and back again -- you'll love this movie!","This movie is spectacular in every way.

1,"Ellen Page Makes ""Juno"" a Great Film","Ellen Page plays Juno MacGuff, a teenager who becomes pregnant by her high school boyfriend whom she reluctantly denies that she loves. Juno is faced with the task of trying to decide whether to have an abortion or give her unborn child up for adoption. But ends up deciding to give up her baby for adoption and goes about finding the perfect parents to adopt her unborn child.Juno Macguff isn't your average teenage beauty involved in sports, cheerleading & so on... She's into music and is funny in a dry/witty/dark humor kind of way.... Ellen Page plays the character perfectly and is in fact, the best actor in the movie! I think Ellen Page will remain on the acting scene for a long time with her talent.Anyway, ""Juno"" is definitely a different sort of coming of age story and a good one at that.","Ellen Page plays Juno MacGuff, a teenager who becomes pregnant by her high school boyfriend whom she reluctantly denies that she loves.

1,Wow! Just...Wow!,"How to describe in words a sound that goes beyond mere sound? One author once said that the goal of music is to transport the listener to the state of mind of the musician. But what happens when the music transcends that?The easy way to describe the Jennys would be as a female vocal trio who use strong harmonies and sparse instrumentalization to render folk songs in their own unique and beautiful way.What the Canadian trio accomplishes though is so much more than that. Three voices so perfectly matched as to transcend langauge and to, by their blending, transport the listener beyond the musicians to a place that is beyond simple description; a place where the beauty of the music is all there is.I would recommend this album for anyone with ears and a soul that can still be touched by the beauty of an alchemy of three similar things transmuted by a magic incomprehensible and still accessable by all.","How to describe in words a sound that goes beyond mere sound?

0,I've never been depressed about beauty before.,"This is the most negative Beauty Guide I've ever read. It attempts to debunk nearly every single product in existence and cast plastic surgery as a gleaming beacon of hope. The writer tries to apologize for her plastic surgery loyalty early in, but her style is boring and self-centered, so it's hard to forgive her. This book doesn't get remotely helpful until about 150 pages in. It stops being helpful again at 250 pages. There is very little instruction, and only one section with any pictures to cite examples. It's like the author wrote a beauty guide that applies directly to her and only her. If you want to have a plastic surgery procedure sold to you, read this book. If you want to get excited and informed about beauty, read something else.","This is the most negative Beauty Guide I've ever read.

When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation.

1,Bizarre - but entertaining,"This year, I've found a lot of albums that I've added to my collection, but even so, I never expected to see Twisted Sister show up on my Christmas playlist. A few nights ago, while trying to drift off to sleep, they appeared on the Tonight Show. Let me tell you, friends, for a minute there I thought it was a combination of the pain killers I'm on for my back and the fact that I was half-asleep, but when I saw a guy with pink hair and hair band makeup rocking out to ""Oh Come, All Ye Faithful,"" I had to follow up on it. It's surprisingly good. Basically, they took classic songs and rocked out on `em. It's incredibly surreal to see someone who looks like he should be biting the heads off chicken screaming, ""Oh come let us adore him! Christ! THE! LOOOOOOORD!"" But it's entertaining for what it is.","This year, I've found a lot of albums that I've added to my collection, but even so, I never expected to see Twisted Sister show up on my Christmas playlist.

1,A Good Read,"Upon reading this book, at first I was annoyed with the chain of seemingly petty mini story plots that soon revolve around a timeless girl-cat-fight theme, but found I couldn't put the book down.

It is a very well written, well researched book, that draws the reader in, portraying a world completely different from our own, and besides, isn't that what life is eventually all about? A series of seemingly petty everyday events, with a fight or two mixed in?This is an entertaining book to read. I am disappointed with the ending, however. The ending is much too much ""hollywoodish;"" I feel that personality should really have won out over beauty in the end. That would have been more realistic and educational, instead of leaving us with the conjecture that beauty is everything here in life.","Upon reading this book, at first I was annoyed with the chain of seemingly petty mini story plots that soon revolve around a timeless girl-cat-fight theme, but found I couldn't put the book down.

0,Uneven,"Broderick was well suited for this comic role, and the film begins amusingly enough. However, it runs into a number of problems: 1.) It shifts its tone all over the place, suddenly deciding to become serious over the incident with the car's destruction. Nor is the suddenly serious side aptly resolved. 2.) Ferris oddly abandons his talking to the audience fairly early on. 3.) The makeup throughout has been poorly done. You can see it obviously in every close-up. 4.) Ferris becomes quasi-heroic for mouthing the words to ""Twist and Shout"" in a parade, when actually it is the recorded song itself which seems to be fuelling the joy and mayhem. All in all, the film is pretty shallow, but could have been good had it stayed true to its beginnings, both stylistically and content-wise. It needed another rewrite.","Broderick was well suited for this comic role, and the film begins amusingly enough. However, it runs into a number of problems 1.

1,It's got the goods!,"As was the case with many folks my age, I fell in love with the Marshall Tucker Band during their stay with Capricorn Records. Then, as the 70s waned, many of us were swept up in the punk and new wave movements. I was pretty oblivious to the post-Capricorn MTB recordings. BIG MISTAKE! Thankfully these recordings have been rereleased and we have the opportunity to revisit some of the most timeless music of the past few decades. GREETINGS is the final recording Toy Caldwell made with the band. While this disc may not have the surging power of some other MTB releases, it is an album of immense beauty. Vocalist Doug Gray is in fine form and the instrumental backing is deft and tasteful. If you've ever loved MTB, this CD will surely find a cherished place in your collection.","As was the case with many folks my age, I fell in love with the Marshall Tucker Band during their stay with Capricorn Records.

(duh)She does a very good, coherent job, and moves along steadily. There is humour as well as sadness. I liked the part when she told David O Selznick at their first meeting that she would not wear makeup and would not change anything about her appearance, and if he didn't like it she would go back to Sweden on the next train. I personally am glad he decided she could remain as she was.I recommend this book as a good introduction to Ingrid.

It is a padded hardcover with gold-edged pages; you can't write on the slick pages and if there were any room they fill it with scrolls, curly-q's, added Scripture (don't need that, have my own Bible-several), poetry (??), thoughts to consider (again, I have my own), and then they tell you what to pray. Seriously?? What was simple and sincere, they have made an embellished, pompous and useless book, unless, of course, you want that kind of thing: beauty over function. Certainly not the gift for I intended for a male friend. I don't even want it.","Why do they keep messing with God Calling???

1,Inspired,"This book is like no other. I purchase paper-book copies and give them away. I leave them in hotel rooms, hospitals, doctors office, prisons, etc. You may scoff, but I do believe this book to be divinely inspired. I came across this book about 20 years ago. It was not written by Mr. Russell, he is only the editor. Be sure to read the introduction. The authors or receivers of the messages wished to remain anonymous, and no doubt are no longer living since the messages came around 1930 I believe. Read ""Savanah""s comments. I agree with her 100 % for I have found everything she said to be true for me also. I have probably bought over 100 copies and am now ordering 10 more as I am out of stock. I always order at least enough to qualify for the free shipping which is nice. Other ""inspirational"" books pale next to this. As for myself, I cant believe these two women made this up, there is too much truth and beauty in the ""messages"". This is a book for the ages and will never be out of date.","This book is like no other. I purchase paper-book copies and give them away.

1,"Great Movie, But Where Is the Rest of the Picture?","""The Innocents"" is without doubt one of the best ghost films (or is it a study in psychopathology?) ever made. Unfortunately, in this video format, almost half of the picture is missing! It was shot in Cinemascope for showing on a wide screen. On video, we are deprived of much of the visual beauty and drama. We see actors speaking into empty space, while offscreen voices answer. Just as bad, we may see two noses conversing! The marketing department at Fox should wake up. There are people who want to see ALL of the movie.....","The Innocents is without doubt one of the best ghost films or is it a study in psychopathology? ever made.

1,Mirror works well.,"Pros: the magnification works well, without distortion. The mirror is light and easy to transport if needed.Cons: the touch-light base does not work well for me as I constantly hit it by accident when applying makeup.","Pros the magnification works well, without distortion.

1,Hellacious you fool,"Dear Hellacious,If I didn't know any better i'd think you were a (young) girl as well given your music tastes... dashboard confessional is not punk, just for reference. It's clearly emotinal music. so before you go bashing Emo, you should recognize that you're obviously a Fan. hypocrite central.

1,When music has feelings,"When I heard Parachutes a couple of years ago, I wondered whether this band would have ever produced such a good album. This album is a smacking answer to my question. Not only is this album as good as Parachutes, but its also much better, melodically, lyrically and musically.From the very first track to the last track, this album is flawless. Even after listening for the first time, I realised that this album is a masterpiece. Songs like 'In My Place' and 'The Scientist' are examples of songs that really come straight from the heart, and this is, in my opinion what makes this album so great.Two other songs which stand out on this album are Politik and the title track which are both 5-star songs with such beauty that they just make you want to lay down on your bed with your headphones and forget about the rest of the world.If you invest in this CD, you won't regret it.","When I heard Parachutes a couple of years ago, I wondered whether this band would have ever produced such a good album.

0,Almost Boring,"This book is not worth the paper it was written on. I couldn't even finish it. It doesn't take a lot to please me when it come to romance novels, but I'm sorry but this one doesn't even come close. The only good thing I can say about ""Almost Innocent"" is that the cover art looks nice. The characters are shollow and hard to believe. If your looking for a good read try ""Beauty Like The Night"" by Liz Carlyle. Now that's a romance novel.","This book is not worth the paper it was written on. I couldn't even finish it.

1,Excellent book... beautifully written... could not put this down.,"This book is a work of peace and beauty. Each chapter starts with a quick note on unique Mayan herbs and identifies their healing properties. This alone is a treasure. Sastun also gives an insightful, sensitive look into the character a true healer who deeply cares for his patients, mourns his lonliness, yet is energized by his spiritual support he receives in his healing and the thankfulness of his humble, hard-working and trusting Mayan patients. Personally, I loved this book... it reads quickly and easily, is beautifully written with touching humor and is remarkably uplifting.","This book is a work of peace and beauty.

1,Appreciating the struggle,"Gloria Koenig has written a wonderful book about what it takes to get icons established. Not everyone is excited about new ideas and the perserverence required to build these well-known structures is often forgotten or misunderstood as we embrace those places that define Los Angeles. Each building, structure, or monument is thoughtfully explored, in rich, condensed prose and the photographs reveal the beauty and majesty of iconic Los Angeles. A good read, fabulous photographs, and thoughtful examination of the process to get from here to there. Most all my favorites are here.","Gloria Koenig has written a wonderful book about what it takes to get icons established.

0,Yuk!,"If you like really badly acted horror films this one is for you! The film is a curiosity: wonderful crisp, black & white cinematography wasted on a pointless plot, incredibly bad makeup: rubber wigs seams abound, even a misspelled title card, but if you long for the kind of bad movie-making from the Toxic Avenger school of cinema, you came to the right place. Acne makes the original Night of the Living Dead look like a Masterpiece Theater production in comparison.","If you like really badly acted horror films this one is for you!

1,The most useful make-up book I'd ever read.,"I also have other beauty books, like ""Making Faces"", ""Beauty Bible"",""The Art of Makeup"". But I find, this one is the most useful!! Maybe the other book have very beautiful or even dramatic pics, but are those looks suitable for everyday-beauty? I don't think so. Whatever your are new or expert of makeup, this book is worthy to buy and read again, and again! All the basic techniques and ideas will help you to create your OWN beauty style for an elegant, won't-updated look.","I also have other beauty books, like Making Faces, Beauty Bible,The Art of Makeup.

1,A Brilliant Writer,"This is the first Barbara Kingsolver novel I read, based on some good reviews. I discovered a new voice, one that is unique to me, and I have read thousands of books--from Tolstoy to Tan. Kingsolver's writing is delicious. She is blessed with tremendous talent and insight. Other Amazon reviews will tell you the plot of this book, but I won't, because I was so enthralled by the absolute beauty and power of her writing that the story--as great as it was--was not my main focus while reading. Of course, I have since read The Bean Trees, Pigs In Heaven and Animal Dreams, and I have received the same treat each time I read one of her books...I get to revel in splendid writing.","This is the first Barbara Kingsolver novel I read, based on some good reviews.

1,An excellent chill out album,"I first heard this album while perusing a bookstore. I was struck by it's simplicity and the overall feeling it gives. A very chilled out, jazzy little piece of work--I enjoy it immensely. Ms. Jones' vocals are very pretty, with just the right amount of breathy tone and melancholy.The arrangements on this album are all straight-forward and simple, but are played well; I especially enjoy Brian Blade's work. Part of the beauty of this album is it's simplicity, it's perfect for listening by yourself or with a group of people just relaxing.I give this album a four out of five stars because I do feel that some of the tracks begin to sound alike as the album progresses, but this detracts from the overall picture in only a small way. Once again I say that I enjoyed this album very much and I'm looking forward to hearing more from this talented young lady in the future.","I first heard this album while perusing a bookstore.

1,Decent lens,"I bought this lens with my new Canon Rebel XT. It was recommended by one of my friends and I thank him very much for letting me know this beauty. It works very well for indoor portrait shooting and I got quite some nice photos for my baby.Only one thing worries me a bit. It doesn't look like it is going to hold on for a long time. But with $70 something as the price, I know I should't expect too much.","I bought this lens with my new Canon Rebel XT.

1,A ray of Joyous Light,"I have admired Rocio Durcal since I was a child. However, Caricias is the first cd of hers that I have purchased. I had been unable to listen to her music for a number of years and Caricias was the cd which reintroduced me to Rocio's stunning voice. From start to finish, this cd takes you on an incredible emotional journey. Rocio speaks to your heart and shares the emotions she feels while singing each individual song. This cd is a must for anyone who appreciates beauty and who can relate to the summits and valleys which are experienced when one falls in love or is betrayed etc... since purchasing this cd, I have purchased several others.","I have admired Rocio Durcal since I was a child.

0,"Great Nostalgia, Good quality CD copy, poor singer","After having a crush on this gorgeous woman for now over 50 years, I thought I'd get one of her CDs. I never saw throughher beauty before to see how bad of a singer she really was. Fortunately, the background singers and music on most of her songs drownout her voice enough to where the music is actually decent to listen to.Buy this CD only for it's nostalgic value, not for it's entertainment value.The CD itself is not a normally manufactured CD. It clearly is a copy, with what appears to be an inkjet printed label. The tone quality and stereo separation is excellent however.","After having a crush on this gorgeous woman for now over 50 years, I thought I'd get one of her CDs.

1,My favorite Deep Forest cd!,"The standard US version of this release is mysteriously OUT OF PRINT for some reason! However, this is an import version titled ""World mix"" with different cover artwork and bonus mixes and therefore is an essential item for those who cannot get a hold of a copy of the original Deep Forest albumDeep Forest came around shortly after the huge success of Enigma who combined Gregorian chants to ambient dance rhythms. Deep Forest came up with a similar concept except it was to mix Pygmy/African vocal samples with dance rhythms creating a sound all it's own. While the following Deep Forest cds have been great as well, none of them have matched the qualities and beauty found on this release and therefore it is among one of most essentials albums of the progressive world music genres of all time.","The standard US version of this release is mysteriously OUT OF PRINT for some reason!

1,Black bodies radiating heat,"One wonderful thing about human variety is that it brings so many different faces and figures to the word ""beauty."" Allen devotes this book to one range of that beauty, the one dominated by its African heritage. Even that, as these photos show, covers a fair range in itself.Many of these photos focus on the hair, the curves, the lovely faces, and other features that distinguish black beauty from the other kinds. The net effect, to my eye, does not set black beauty apart. Instead, these photos display the beauty common to women everywhere, with a few genetic highlights to remind the viewer just varied that can be. This brings an enjoyable and welcome complement to collections that often under-represent this branch of the human family.-- wiredweird","One wonderful thing about human variety is that it brings so many different faces and figures to the word beauty.

There is no need to compare it to the great Miles and Coltrane version or any of Monk's wonderful solo recordings but for guitar players he has simply NAILED THIS GREAT SONG AT IT'S MOST SOULFUL HEART and fills the room with beauty.There are musicians that play their instruments and those that seemingly become theirs.

He turns to her and tells her ""Whatever you do, stay alive!"" More powerful than telling her I love you, more powerful than any passionate proposal. The compelling part of the film is the chase and running of the film and the complex racial and political issues.

0,Unbiblical and pretentious,"No wonder this movie was a flop when it was released. It is pretentious and makes up its own story line instead of following any of the Gospel stories.

So wonderous was the flow of words and the manifestation of Gibrans mind that I felt tears at the incredible beauty of the whole, I even shuddered in joy brought about by the realisation that this work of art exists- kind of like when first reading the Brothers Karamazov, seeing a Michaelangelo, or viewing a spectacular film of nature (Blue Planet, Pattagonia and the like); one is left in awe.","I don't believe all readers would share the response I had, and this would be a shame, for rarely have I been so moved.

After having reviewed some of the comments I get the feeling that some American friends are used to read short and simple sentences! German language is famous for the complicated structure and long sentences. It is wonderful to read this book in German esp. because of the use of language.

1,"""captivating"" yes, but moreso than that word can describe","I must say that this music is so beautiful, so enthralling, that it seems almost dangerous to me. Powerfully spiritual, it puts one in a state of quasi-meditative contentment that makes one feel no real need to do anything else.... This is a cd I listen to only when I have time to let it absorb me completely with its blissful beauty far from the physical world & into the nonphysical before recovering & getting back to the grind. This cd does that more than other sitar music; I'm not sure hows. Very highly recommended for anyone who can handle glimpses of God.","I must say that this music is so beautiful, so enthralling, that it seems almost dangerous to me.

1,Hawaii's downfall,"Queen Liliuokalani was a very trusting and good hearted soul...she trusted the wrong haoles and paid for it very dearly with the loss of her islands. The old saying goes....""When the white man came, they told us to look up to the heavens, to God, and when we looked down, our land was gone"". It's very sad. She was very well educated and proud of her people. It's too bad the US couldn't just leave the islands alone as they ruined the beauty of it....it's become another ""Miami Beach"" resort....nothing special.","Queen Liliuokalani was a very trusting and good hearted soul...she trusted the wrong haoles and paid for it very dearly with the loss of her islands.

1,Best for a busy family!,As a busy working Mom this is the best thing I have ever bought. I have even made a pie in this beauty. Heats up fast and works great. Worked well with the Thanksgiving turkey when I needed to get the rolls going. I highly recommend this oven.

1,"Corgan's best since ""Adore""","SP has always been about Billy Corgan. I simply think this is his best work since ""Adore"" which was probably overlooked by all but the most ardent SP fans-- it was too different from other work and had no ""1979"" or ""Today"". ""Adore"" has some great songs and beautiful guitar work. It seems that after ""Adore"" Billy went off into sonics, as witness Zwan (just a lot of noise to me) and his solo work. On ""Zeitgeist"" I declare that Billy the genius guitar hero is back. Here the sonics work! Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Adore, though, for the beauty Billy's capable of producing.","SP has always been about Billy Corgan.

0,NOT MUCH AT STAKE,"Gary Oldman as Dracula makes as much sense as Bela Lugosi as Lenny Bruce. The redeeming bit of this film fiasco is Anthony Hopkins as a bizarre and interesting Van Helsing. This isn't Bram Stoker, it's Francis Ford Copulating with the script, and patting himself on the back in the process. (The cinematograph scene is useless). You'll see some scene sendups of The Exorcist, Dracula as Phyllis Diller (at least that's what his makeup looked like to me with that stupid hairdo in the castle), and Winny Ryder when she's not busy boosting in a store or something else to get herself busted. Reeves as Jonathan Harker??? You must be kidding. The only thing worse than his Brit accent in this one was his Southern accent in Devil's Advocate.

1,Darwin's revenge on Moses Best of the series,It is quite a small irony that Charlton Heston (Moses) is the star of this movie. He builds the franchise well as Taylor the self-absorbed commander reduced to animal in a cage. He plays the role well but has plenty of help. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall (one of the most underrated actors who have been)and Maurce Evans do their best to steal the show. (Particularly Evans who's proves the screen presence of a great stage actor cuts through any amount of makeup. The passion and interaction of the characters as they argue their cases mirrors the arguements of the times which is one of the movie's strengths. Well shot and quite a spectacle considering the scale of the movie. The franchise that follows never comes to this level and the amount of parody it has spawned doesn't cut it. But this one is a winner. It only remains to see if the remake can match it.,It is quite a small irony that Charlton Heston Moses is the star of this movie.

1,More Wonderful Music by Janetta Petkus,"I loved Petkus' first single CD, ""Moving in Time"", so I wondered if I would be disappointed in this second effort. Happily, I must say that this set equals ""Moving in Time"" in its beauty, quality, and depth. I especially enjoyed Track 1 of the Pitta CD, and the Kapha CD is perfect for unwinding. For those that spend long periods at the computer, the Vata CD is just the thing for keeping you energized and creative!","I loved Petkus' first single CD, Moving in Time, so I wondered if I would be disappointed in this second effort.

1,Lots of good stuff on this one,"I'd like to get my hands on several of these pieces but they're hard to find. I'm a professional trumpet player, but I think most people would enjoy these highly accessible works. The McKinley is a fun piece if you have a bassoonist and the Gould is a gem. My personal fave is the Carbon for sheer originality and beauty of melody and harmony. Actually, they're all good pieces. Give this one a try!","I'd like to get my hands on several of these pieces but they're hard to find.

Taylor's words also inspire, and encourage. If he can do this, he seems to be saying, so can we. With so much ugliness in the world, these beautiful works of art remind us that we don't need to dwell in darkness. Through our minds, we can open ourselves into higher realms of light, beauty, and truth. A wonderful gift book!

1,Worth it for the trio of hits,"The Herd enjoyed exactly three UK hits, and they are all here in magnificent stereo sound. ""From the Underworld"", ""Paradise Lost"", and ""I Don't Want our loving to Die"" all hit the UK Top 20, the latter made it to No. 4. Unfortunately, the band chose to start writing its own A-sides, and that's where they went wrong. Of the other material here, there is frankly little to recommend. ""The Game"", recorded after Frampton bailed out, is a noble attempt at a commercial record, but its B-side, ""Beauty Queen"" is actually better. ""Diary of a Narcissist"" is amusing enough, but much of their other recordings pale in comparision to the hits. If you love late '60s UK commercial pop, get this CD for them.","The Herd enjoyed exactly three UK hits, and they are all here in magnificent stereo sound.

0,"One hit wonders, and deservedly so","I was completely blown away the first time I heard ""I Don't Mind"", and decades later I still love the song. I owned this album first time around, having run out to buy it as soon as I heard the single. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Nothing else on the album comes even remotely close to the beauty and pathos of that song. In fact, with the possible exceptions of ""Waiting for the Worm to Turn"" and ""Coma"" (the other track to feature the string quartet heard so prominently in ""I Don't Mind""), nothing else was even close to listenable for me.Your mileage may vary, of course, but I strongly encourage potential buyers to listen to the online samples rather than assuming that the album's other nine tracks will compare to its one big hit.","I was completely blown away the first time I heard I Don't Mind, and decades later I still love the song.

1,A dream,"Moulin Rouge is like a dream. A fresh, exuberant dream. There are fantastical landscapes, caricature supporting characters that show depth at unexpected moments, startling juxtapositions. There are recurring themes of truth, beauty, freedom and love. There is the vibrant happiness that the 2 leads find in each other. And of course the conflict that threatens to tear them apart. Add fine acting, lively anachronistic song-and-dance numbers and stunning visuals, and you've got a film that's great entertainment.","Moulin Rouge is like a dream. A fresh, exuberant dream.

1,Better Than It Sounds!,"I was a little skeptical too when I saw the commercial. A movie musical with Nicole Kidman and the Star Wars guy? And yet, it turned out great! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman actually have talent! Who would've thought? (Really, Ewan MacGregor should have taken up singing professionally. His voice could topple skyscrapers!) Though most of the songs here are just re-used, re-done pop hits, they fit the story very well. (""Your Song is the best! I rewind it about ten times whenever I watch this movie) The story is very unique. It manages to go from absolutely hilarious to tear-jerkingly serious. (If you don't cry at the end, you have no heart, and if you aren't rolling with laughter during the scene in Satine's elephant, you have no sense of humor)In short, great story, great songs, great actors, great show!

1,Victoriana coming of age,"Admittedly, I do prefer 1987`s 'Helleborine' - as the last reviewer quite rightly said, it`s over-the-top and the classical composition displays so much attention to detail it borders on obsession - but for beauty and sheer escapism hardly anything else comes close. Having said that, 'Century Flower' is a delight to listen to. The sweeping Victorian musical vistas of 'Helleborine' get a kick - there`s a psychedelic Floyd/Strawberry Alarm Clock edge to tracks like 'Timeblind' and 'Self', although the overall effect is entirely their own creation. Highlights are the pastoral country-house loveliness of the title track, the explosive, breathy 'Shatter', the gloriously twisted prettiness of 'Timeblind' and the pounding 'The Silent Day'. A band unlike any other.","Admittedly, I do prefer 1987s 'Helleborine' - as the last reviewer quite rightly said, its over-the-top and the classical composition displays so much attention to detail it borders on obsession - but for beauty and sheer escapism hardly anything else comes close.

1,Beautiful movie,"I think this movie deserved every bit of hype it received. Last year's abundance of comic book movies and Matrix sequels really turned me off. This movie brought together two characters with much in common though at different stages of their lives/marriages and avoided all unhappy marriage/lonely character clichés. The beauty of this movie lies in what doesn't happen.Most people I know who didn't like this movie were expecting a Bill Murray ""comedy"". It is, but not in the obvious ways. It is so much more. Murray and Scarlett Johansen were perfectly cast - I could not imagine any other actors playing these parts.","I think this movie deserved every bit of hype it received.

1,Superb Quality and Features,"While understanding my deep love for Bond films may have influenced this rating, I did find the blu-ray to have excellent sound and picture quality, not to mention a bevy of features that kept me watching long after the film had ended. I viewed it on a 1080p LED 46"" Samsung tv with a Boston Acoustics 2.1 sound bar and was thoroughly impressed by the depth of sound even without a 5.1 or greater speaker setup. Bond fans will enjoy the film that restarted the franchise and everyone else will enjoy the beauty of the movie set in many exotic locations.","While understanding my deep love for Bond films may have influenced this rating, I did find the blu-ray to have excellent sound and picture quality, not to mention a bevy of features that kept me watching long after the film had ended.

1,"Don't try it, just buy it!","Shrek was wonderful! Having not seen it at the theater, I rented it the week before Christmas as a trial for gift-giving for my young kids (3 and 5 yrs old). They loved it and so did we! Now we own it! The music makes them (and us) want to crank up the surround sound system and get up and dance, and we all laugh hysterically throughout it...especially at Donkey's antics, Shrek's comments and tolerance of Donkey, and Fiona's singing. While amusing and colorful to watch, it also supports the underlying message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that everyone has feelings to consider. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to see, or even hear, a fun movie, or who wants to find themselves laughing repeatedly. There are a few slight incidentals of adult humor the children may not catch on to, and some they will. But it just adds to the attention captured from audiences of all ages.

1,A Masterpiece,"This Movie (American Beauty), deserved every award it received, and maybe even more. It tells the story of a ""typical"" suburban family, but shows the whole dark side of their life. Lester Burnham, played perfectly by Kevin Spacey, is a father and husband, and throughout the movie makes so many mistakes, which make us laugh, but in the end, it's all so emotional and you won't beleive what happens when it does. All I can say is... if you want to a true masterpiece, which only comes out every few years or so, American Beauty is a must-see on DVD, because the fatures are fantastic, also.","This Movie American Beauty, deserved every award it received, and maybe even more.

It reminds us of the personal things that we find beautiful. And it tells us to push beyond the surface of things so we might find that which we did not see before. Its a film filled with powerful performances and heartbreaking tradgety. Some people may not understand this type of movie. But those people are blind anyway, and probably are obsessed with action movies. And lets face it those are the worst people. AND WHATS WITH THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS DVD. DONT YOU BUY A DVD FOR THE MOVIE, NOT THE EXTRAS. Thanks for that. AMERICAN BEAUTY is master storytelling and well possibly the most brilliant film of all time.","American Beauty is a great film.

1,"""Beauty""-ful Movie","I think that ""American Beauty"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is so beautifully done and definitely deserved every single award it has recieved. There is also a great ensemble cast including Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening who make the screen light up and make you anticipate what is going to happen. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection. Excellent! 10/10!",I think that American Beauty is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

1,"For intelligent people, not morons","This is not a bad movie at all. It does however take an individual with a half bit of creativity, imagination and intelligence to see this movie for what it's worth. If you're the kind of person that can see past the figurative shell of the movie than this is the movie for you. If you are the kind of person that only watches movies where everything is laid out in front of you for you to sit back and not have to think, of course, you will not like this flick.American Beauty is about our crazy, messed up society in the good old US of A in the suburbia that more than half of us live in. It is also the story of everyone, hiding or changing their true selves to fit a desirable lifestyle.Watch this movie if you are into reading into the movie for underlying meanings and symbolism. The acting is suberb also.Important: dont waste your time with this or any other good movie if follow along the same foolishness that Mar. 23's review delivers.","This is not a bad movie at all.

0,3rd day of christmas 2011 review,"On the 3rd day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...The live action remake of The Grinch. The sets are poor at best. The camera work is awful. Jim Carrey's preformance as The Grinch is over-the-top & very cartoony even though his makeup is pretty cool. Some of the jokes are atrocious like the jokes on South Park. The story drugs on & on with pointless subplots. The Whos in this film are even worse then The Grinch himself. While it does follow the book at the 3rd act,its still a bad film. I give this film a 2 out of 10.","On the 3rd day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...The live action remake of The Grinch. The sets are poor at best. The camera work is awful.

0,Just Bad,"First of all, I'll say I can think of no compelling reason for anyone to watch this movie.Plot? Man takes lovely, young new wife and skeptical children on a vacation to - Africa? The lovely wife and children find themselves trapped in a jeep surrounded by a hungry - and apparently murderous - pride of lions. Think Cujo on safari, only the dog was menacing and we actually believed Dee Stone and son were in peril. In Prey, stuck inside a jeep for days, no one even sweats or loses makeup. They do, however, truly annoy with innane conversation and predicatable mishaps. There are a few extras in this borefest who serve as delicacies for the wildlife, but virtually any nature show on Natural Geographic has more intense kill scenes than this tripe. I found myself pulling for the lions.","First of all, I'll say I can think of no compelling reason for anyone to watch this movie.Plot?

1,A perfectly written Russian masterpiece,"Ivan Turgenev's ""Fathers and Sons"" ranks with his ""Sketches from a Hunter's Album"" as one of the most perfectly written and deeply moving books I have ever read. It far surpasses most of Dostoyevsky's works and possibly, in my opinion, could outrank even Tolstoy. A reader with a good knowledge of Russia will not fail to appreciate ""Fathers and Sons"" and will not at all regret the cost of this book. I was not able to put it down, not so much from being riveted to an adventurous plot, but from being captivated by the sublime, marvelous beauty of Turgenev's prose (and, of course, Rosemary Edmonds' wonderful translation). ""Fathers and Sons"" is a very powerful book, eye-opening and profoundly sad, which every reader will appreciate.","Ivan Turgenev's Fathers and Sons ranks with his Sketches from a Hunter's Album as one of the most perfectly written and deeply moving books I have ever read.

1,An Insightful Peruse of Beantown,"Boston is a city that is a tourist haven. With its rich historical atmosphere as well as the accouterments of a modern-day metropolis, it would be easy to lose focus and miss out on all the city has to offer. I was impressed with the way that the video avoided this pitfall by laying out the city in a logical fashion. While it may be impossible to see all that Boston has to offer in a one week vacation, the video gave me some definite ideas about the things that would make my trip the most meaningful for me and my family. This is the beauty of the video-that the material is presented as a smörgsbord, and the viewer can choose what to consume in greater detail when they visit. The due diligence the producers paid in researching the history of Boston was much appreciated as well.","Boston is a city that is a tourist haven.

0,Meh....,"Firstly, Dr. Etcoff opens her book with a reference to Naomi Wolf; however, her interpretation of The Beauty Myth is deeply flawed, as is much of the book. While Etcoff claims to use ""cutting edge"" studies, a quick glance through the back of the book reveals that many of the studies cited are decades old. The book lacks cohesive organization; Etcoff cites multi-cultural studies but fails to integrate them into a cohesive argument. Etcoff fails to convince one of her thesis; rather than writing a serious, comprehensive inquiry into the biological basis for beauty, she opted to make a quick buck with this sensationalist, scattered book.","Firstly, Dr. Etcoff opens her book with a reference to Naomi Wolf however, her interpretation of The Beauty Myth is deeply flawed, as is much of the book.

1,Chock full of Jewish holiday food and decorating ideas,Rita Brownstein has created a unique guide to celebrating the Jewish holidays creatively. She combines outstanding artistic and culinary talents with a deep appreciation and knowledge of Jewish customs and laws. The result is a new and exciting approach to the annual cycle of traditional Jewish observance. This is not just a cookbook or only a home decorating book. This book will appeal to those who know the Sabbath and holiday celebrations are not just dinner parties. Beautiful decorations and holiday symbols enhance their beauty and meaning.

0,Terrible Movie!,"What a terrible, ponderous, senseless movie. With Sharon Stone touted in the cast, one would at least hope for some attractiveness in the film, but she was painted with some kind of lip wound, and make-up did their best to hide her beauty. Nick Nolte was the typical anti-social drunk/druggie that he often plays, and Bridges was as hapless as he usually is. There was no identification with anyone in this movie, neither sympathy or pity, except, perhaps, for the horse. Skip this one; there is nothing positive or redemptive about it!","What a terrible, ponderous, senseless movie.

Between their brand of catchy ska-pop, and ""Gwens"", um, talent, they could do no wrong. This collects most of the best stuff. Included are the two breakout hits ""Just A Girl"" and ""Don't Speak"", from ""Tragic Kingdom"". Then there's ""Simple Kind Of Life"" and ""Ex-girlfriend"", from ""Return Of Saturn"", and ""Hey Baby"" and ""Underneath It All"", from ""Rock Steady"". Plus ""New"", which was also on the ""Go"" soundtrack. All that, and the new cover of ""It's My Life"", which I think they did a great job on. There's so many hits it's hard to complain. But if I could throw on two more, it would be ""Different People"", and ""Magics In The Makeup"". If this isn't enough ""No Doubt"" for you, check out the new box set ""Boom Box"". Otherwise, this is a collection you should be ""Running"" to the store for.","Man did this band get, and stay popular the past 5-10 years, and rightly so.

0,If you are even curious about this book you have a low IQ.,"Paris Hilton is trash with money. No class, compassion or cultural awareness. She offers nothing in here. I gasped in horror at seeing it at an ex-girlfriend's house and that is how I know what is in it. Hopefully at one point she will come to understand that she should have gone to college instead using daddy's hotel money to become famous for having no talent and no beauty. Go away Paris Hilton, please. I almost didn't vote because I saw her billboard in Times Square saying ""Vote Or Die!""","Paris Hilton is trash with money. No class, compassion or cultural awareness.

0,Not worth your money or time,"I knew better than to buy this book, but curiosity has gotten the best of people greater than myself, and when I was at a bookstore recently I had to thumb through it.It's much like what you would expect; a half-baked ""inspirational"" message that you should ""always be your own heiress, be true to yourself, etc,"" but mostly the book went on and on about her favorite beauty products, activities, and so on.If you're curious, head to a local bookstore and look through out.

1,Best ever,"Albolene cream is the best makeup remover that I have ever used, especially for eye makeup. It is non greasy, yet still moisturizes my face. A tiny bit goes a long way and feels so good on my face. I used to be able to buy it in any drug store and they no longer carry it. Thank Goodness for Amazon since I could not used anything else.","Albolene cream is the best makeup remover that I have ever used, especially for eye makeup.

1,Herbal Essence Review,"Surprisingly in Salisbury this town of 30,000 in NC the local Walmart, Eckerds, CVS, and Walgreens no longer carry this product as they stock only their similar namebrand. The local JC Penny and Belks department store cosmetics dept also do not carry this item. Amazon purchase was less time consuming then trying to buy and save a few bucks on Ebay. I was pleased with the promptness of shipment and the price seemed reasonable. The product itself has been used a long time by my elderly mother and was bought as a birtday present.","Surprisingly in Salisbury this town of 30,000 in NC the local Walmart, Eckerds, CVS, and Walgreens no longer carry this product as they stock only their similar namebrand.

1,Another Response to UCLA Student,"Di Stefano is generally recognized as having hands-down one ofthe most beautiful tenor voices in history, perhaps ranking in the topthree. His singing on this CD, though a bit past his prime, still displays a purity and beauty of timbre rarely matched in today's best tenors. Anyone who would describe Di Stefano's voice as ""ordinary"" does not know the first thing about singing. Di Stefano's voice has a velvety richness and melting sweetness that is instantly recognizable by even the least knowledgeable of opera fans.","Di Stefano is generally recognized as having hands-down one ofthe most beautiful tenor voices in history, perhaps ranking in the topthree.

1,Forever Amber,"Few books make it onto my ""do not sell...will read again"" list. Forever Amber is one of them. It always astounds me how a naive, yet beautiful girl can navigate through a ruthless world. I always questions whether it's her tenacity, luck, or her beauty. Needless to say, I always get sucked in.You can although tell that it was written mid 20th century in it's writing style. What was considered ""pushing the cusp"" then, is truly nothing to even blink at in this day and age. But it gave inspiration to push the limits for many romantic novelists, and writers of historical fiction, and for that many romance novel readers can be thankful!","Few books make it onto my do not sell...will read again list.

I tend to have sensitive and dry skin, especially in the winter, so I was very worried about drying. But the face wash was gentle and didn't dry out my skin. The smell of the product is mild and pleasant, barely there, and it's very easy to use. I can definitely tell that my skin is cleaner. Especially now that I've stopped wearing makeup since my son was born, I tend to have more blackheads than ever, but they seem to be all gone now.","I used the product for the past week, and it did a great job.

1,Cherish the Touch,"Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu would have been able to do credit to the effort to review this book of their poems. I envy the exquisite beauty of these poems.

But this is his best, most poetic album so far; timeless in the sense that live tribe music never dies.

1,Good gift for tween girls,"I bought this for a birthday gift for an 11 year old. I was hoping it would teach her how to apply makeup correctly, however, the makeup is not intended for use on the skin. The kit is to experiment with different shades of color on paper for eyes, cheeks, & lips. It comes with a face-shape guide, a hairstyle guide and pre-printed faces that you apply color to and draw on hairstyles with the included colored pencils. It's kind of like a coloring book, but with real looking makeup. I think she'll like it and will enjoy experimenting with it.","I bought this for a birthday gift for an 11 year old.

1,More than the Movie,"As much as I enjoy watching old Ginger Rogers movies, it always saddens me that the film version of ""Kitty Foyle"" has so overshadowed Morley's novel.Written in the stream-of-consciousness style, ""Kitty Foyle"" is both a coming-of-age novel and a novelistic ""study"" of the white collar career girl of the 1930s. Kitty is from Philadelphia, but spends her high school years in a small town in Illinois, and ultimately ends up working [in the cosmetic industry] in New York City. Morley is excellent at presenting these various mileu unjudgmentally [he leaves that for the reader] but vividly and accurately. He is also excellent at creating ""real"" characters, who face moral dilemmas and who are changed because of their decisions. It is an entertaining and delightful read, as well as being a thoughtful read.","As much as I enjoy watching old Ginger Rogers movies, it always saddens me that the film version of Kitty Foyle has so overshadowed Morley's novel.Written in the stream-of-consciousness style, Kitty Foyle is both a coming-of-age novel and a novelistic study of the white collar career girl of the 1930s.

1,Gia,"I first learnt about Gia when I flipped on the tv console after a long day (yeah, life is such!) and was immediately caught up about the frequent mention of this supermodel who I hadn't the faintest idea of (knew most of the supermodels of this and the past era). Surfing the net brought me to ""Thing of Beauty"" and I was hooked on getting the video. The performances of the main casts were captivating. I felt myself transitioning from enjoying Angelina Jolie's performance of a smart street kid, to the wonders of an 'insight' as such to the world of fashion and decadence, to the wonderment of her boldness in courting, the eroticism of the lesbian scene, and the pains of her insecurity, to the final sadness when Gia realized so much too late. All this even though I read the book prior to the movie. If nothing else, one would learn the true appreciation of the education of HIV today to the general population. It feels good to see Gia immortalised in print and movie...","I first learnt about Gia when I flipped on the tv console after a long day yeah, life is such! and was immediately caught up about the frequent mention of this supermodel who I hadn't the faintest idea of knew most of the supermodels of this and the past era.

1,One of the best - finally on DVD.,"A fantastic movie. I'm happy they finally got around to getting this on dvd. Except for the fact that there's no extras, everything about this release is great. The picture and sound is top-notch. You'd think that, as an anniversary edition, they would have made an effort to include a variety of extras to expand on the making of this beauty of a film and maybe some history behind it. God knows it was a benchmark for a great deal of the sci-fi movies to come out afterwards. Regardless, you get a great movie at a good price so I guess we should be happy with that. Maybe someone will release an expanded edition at a later date.","A fantastic movie. I'm happy they finally got around to getting this on dvd.

0,Not for everyone... esp. me,"I have tried BM twice now, and it just does not work for me. I moisturize and use primer, the makeup never looks right. I cannot blend it to match my skin tone, it rests heavy in my pores and makes my skin look ""dirty"". More to the point, it makes a mess in my bathroom. I do love that it is a powder versus a traditional foundation - but that's the only plus for me...as for whatever reason, the makeup irritates my skin a bit upon application (maybe the brushes). Overall, it does not work for me at all and I will be returning it to Sephora. Hope you have better luck!","I have tried BM twice now, and it just does not work for me.

0,Did not work with my skin!,"When I applied this makeup, I loved it! I have very clear skin and after I put it on my skin looked soft and pretty. My job involves a lot of running around and I sweat, but when I had the bare minerals on it was so light weight and breathable. It doesnt completely cover all my blemishes though, I had to use an additional concealer for them. I used it for about a week and I started to notice my skin getting red. Then I broke out HORRIBLY... I had huge cysts like pimples that I have never got before! It was all along my jaw line and my chin. I didn't realize with was the makeup that was making my face breakout until about 3 weeks later I finally stopped using it. It took awhile for my face to get back to normal. Now I use Clinque, it doesnt make my face breakout. A lot of people had great results with this product but I believe it all depends on your skin type! I didnt know my skin was so sensitve because I never had problems with it before!","When I applied this makeup, I loved it!

1,"Easy to use, Quick and looks good!","At first I thought this make-up accentuated the fine lines in my over 50 face. But then I used a primer (not theirs), which is essential for any foundation, and it looked really good. iI gave it 4 stars because airbrushed makeup, which does take longer, looks a tad better.","At first I thought this make-up accentuated the fine lines in my over 50 face.

0,too thick and highlights flaws,"I don't recommend this makeup. I am a very youthful looking 32 (no ""fine lines"" yet) and this makeup made my skin look terrible. It's too thick, to start with. I tried applying it with a brush and with a powder puff and neither worked well. It highlighted every small flaw and looked too thick and ""makeup-like"". If you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation, I guess this product would be good. It created an extra layer which creased as the day wore on, making it look like I had wrinkles where I normally don't. Also, this makeup has a shiny look to it.As an alternative, I recommend one of the ""tinted moisturizer"" type products, which are just a light touch. If you have nice looking skin, but just want an added touch of radiance, this product won't be right for you. It's better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup.","I don't recommend this makeup. I am a very youthful looking 32 no fine lines yet and this makeup made my skin look terrible.

0,Don't listen to the other reviews - it's terrible,"Horribly drying. Even with moisturizer twice a day it was terrible. It didn't make me break out, but the powder is weak and comes off on your fingers very easily. You can't touch your face for the entire time you have this on for fear of messing up your skin tone. It is flaky and doesn't spread evenly, as well as being strangely shiny so that it's obvious to see you're wearing makeup. I would not recommend this to anyone. Ever.EDIT: And keep in mind I got this at the actual store so it was not some fake sold to me by an online salesperson.","Horribly drying. Even with moisturizer twice a day it was terrible.

0,not the product i've used for years,"i've been buying bare minerals from a leading makeup retailer for years. i decided to buy on amazon for the lower price and the fast, free prime shipping. this is not the same product i'm used to using. the font on the jar and the packaging materials are slightly different and the product consistency and coverage are not the same at all. i think it was either an old batch, old formula or total knock off. in any event i returned it and will continue to buy this product from the source.","i've been buying bare minerals from a leading makeup retailer for years. i decided to buy on amazon for the lower price and the fast, free prime shipping. this is not the same product i'm used to using. the font on the jar and the packaging materials are slightly different and the product consistency and coverage are not the same at all. i think it was either an old batch, old formula or total knock off. in any event i returned it and will continue to buy this product from the source."
0,Completely Unimpressed,"I've tried this twice, and remain unimpressed. I bought a full size of it two years ago, but pitched it because the texture was so pathetic, and the powder comes off on everything and everyone (including anyone you hug or dance with).Tried it again last week, after getting a sample from Sephora through the Beauty Insider program. Sometimes first impressions of products are wrong. Well, I'm still unimpressed by everything about this product. The coverage is not great, the shades are not great, and the texture feels grainy and like it isn't going to stay in place all day. Not for me.","I've tried this twice, and remain unimpressed.

0,Great literary beauty sabotaged by horrible attempts at pseudoscience,"This is a collection of short stories ``based on'' scientific theories. However, this attempt to give pseudo-scientific explanations/settings to all the stories, spoils the general fable-like literary beauty and charm of these stories. I don't claim that science-fiction should be held to the same standards of rigour and correctness as science itself, but stories that require suspension of disbelief (Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide or Lem's Cyberiad) should not try to explain things within the realm of ``actual'' science. Such stories can develop their own internal self-consistent logical systems, but if they try to connect to actual science then they merely become inconsistent. It is sad to see good literature being wrecked by bad science.","This is a collection of short stories based on'' scientific theories.

1,WOW!!!!,"This book was informative, easy and FUN to read, and WELL worth the money. After reading this, I immediately went out and bought Janice Cox's other book, Natural Beauty at Home.

Although some things that were needed to make the stuff in the book were hard to find, I'm glad I looked for them.","This book was informative, easy and FUN to read, and WELL worth the money.

1,Visually stunning film!,I loved this movie. It deals with so much that it probably could have been divided into several different films. I find that movies that have a lot of characters and a lot of factors involved are among the best. Unfortunately it did not win Best Picture even though it is a more powerful film that American Beauty was. Of course you're going to hear in other reviews how the ending sequence was stupid while I tend to disagree. How else would these people have been brought together? A very different and original way for a climax of a film and I can guarantee you that you will think that it is very cool. I also loved the way the film was directed.The DVD however was a bit of a downer compared to other 2-disc Platinum Series DVD's like Se7en. There's around 100 minutes of bonus material but no commentary which would have been very interesting. I guess the 75 minute documentary takes its place. Other recommendations: Vanilla Sky & Boogie Nights.,I loved this movie. It deals with so much that it probably could have been divided into several different films.

1,"Beautifully written, vivid, heartbreaking","This is an exciting story about pirates, a harem, a dwarf, an emperor, lots of eunuchs, jewels, gardens, religion, beauty, ambition and poison. A dramatic story about a different world, where women are valued for their chubbiness and unibrows. Where men are, well, apparently most of them are nearly psychotic, but at least some of them have redeeming qualities.It is a wonderful book. The language is beautiful. The story is sad but gripping. There were plenty of plot twists, unexpected alliances, and treachery. The main characters are complex, for the most part neither good nor evil, but struggling to rise above situational ethics.I couldn't put this book down. It's the best things I've read in ages.","This is an exciting story about pirates, a harem, a dwarf, an emperor, lots of eunuchs, jewels, gardens, religion, beauty, ambition and poison.

0,Why buy 3 cartridges when the PSP version will have all the breeds on ONE DISC?,"Hello people, save your money! WAIT FOR THE PSP PORT OF NINTENDOGS. Why buy 3 Nintendogs DS cartridges to get all the breeds when, from what I've read and heard, the PSP version of Nintendogs will have all breeds on one UMD disc?!? (that's the beauty of optical media, all 3 breeds can fit onto one UMD disc rather than having to use 3 SEPERATE cartridges, as is seen in the DS version of Nintendogs).So my advice is wait for the PSP version of Nintendogs. You'll only have to buy one UMD disc rather than 3 seperate cartridges (as is seen in the DS iteration of the game)....thus you'll have spare money to boot.","Hello people, save your money!

1,Best Garlic Press,"I had one of these for 10 years and it finally broke. I was delighted to see Amazon had the same one, but it is now`improved. I have not been able to find it in any cooking stores. The beauty of the device is that it does not require peeling the garlic. The residual peel actually allows for easy cleaning as it plucks right out with almost nothing left. I've never had to use the cleaning tool that comes with the press. The improvement is that now it's made with nonstick material. I use it and just place it right in the dishwasher. I make a lot of Caesar salad so the press gets a lot of use. There is no better product out there.","I had one of these for 10 years and it finally broke. I was delighted to see Amazon had the same one, but it is nowimproved.

The production does what modern dress updates so rarely do -- rather than condescend to the audience with look-at-me tricks, each of its bold gestures serves to illuminate and focus the emotional and musical content of the scene. I've only owned it one day and have already watched it twice! Give over to it and you will be generously rewarded.","Stunning in every respect.

0,Too Much,"Roth is not the most subtle of writers, and while I understand this I believe that what ""happens"" in and with this novel, while ""plausible"" (etc.), is simply ""too much"": it's strident, overemphatic, besotted with its own cleaverness and sense of truth, justice and the essential beauty of ""American Way"" and restored American destiny. It is also, in some respects, obscuritanist. For example: somewhere in the endnotes it mentions the fall of Japan and the end of WW2, but it does not mention the little matter of the atomic bomb: a dirty trick by the Americans and not beyond the scope of the novel (but that would ruin the novel's pristine sense of the ""justness"" of the narrative of American history).","Roth is not the most subtle of writers, and while I understand this I believe that what happens in and with this novel, while plausible etc., is simply too much it's strident, overemphatic, besotted with its own cleaverness and sense of truth, justice and the essential beauty of American Way and restored American destiny.

Only people who like American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, and Office Space will be attracted to this trash. Get ready for two hours of your life you will NEVER get back.

Only people who like American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, and Office Space will be attracted to this trash. Get ready for two hours of your life you will NEVER get back. Michael Beihn and Val Kilmer chew through their scenes with immense energy and are worth watching but they can't save this deflated and uninteresting turd. Is this disc any good? Who cares?! Don't waste your time or your money--or wait for it to hit the 5.00 bin at Wal-Mart."

1,Magical Disney Soundtrack,"Received my ""Beauty & The Beast"" soundtrack today. It's a bright, crystal-clear recording, excellent quality. Captures all the magic and beauty of the animated film. Especially enjoy having the soundtracks from our favorite Disney films to listen to on drives to Disneyland--the music sets the mood and gets everyone so excited for the park! Would like to note that my CD did arrive with a badly smashed jewel case. Fortunately the CD isn't damaged and the case is easily replaceable, but a bubble wrap-padded manila envelope is NOT adequate packaging for shipping a CD!!!","Received my Beauty  The Beast soundtrack today.

1,A delicate intersection of past sins and present lives.,"Escapism: why the author writes and why the audience reads -- why I praise Star Flight. Once again Whitney engaged me with her lush, detailed setting, and that ever present ability to allow the reader that leap from simply reading to becoming a part.

0,Give me a break...,"Seriously, who can relate to this book? And how many children really feel excluded because they're beautiful? This may happen on rare occasions, but this book has a truly ridiculous premise. Some of the writing is creative, and I love the illustrations. But I think that the ""moral"" of the book is a bit idiotic. Most children suffer because they're different in some way that is generally less acceptable to society than beauty is. Look at the magazine rack in the bookstore, and all you will see are beautiful faces--faces that young girls hope to aspire to. Let's see a book about inner beauty, Madonna.","Seriously, who can relate to this book? And how many children really feel excluded because they're beautiful?

1,"Brilliant Art, Wise Message, Okay Storytelling","I picked this one up because I'm a Madonna fan, and I really enjoyed her storytelling in the first book ""The English Roses"". Also I'd seen the cover art and was just blown away by its beauty. Loren Long creates a world that's equal parts Norman Rockwell and Edward Hopper, but it's as though you're looking at it reflected onto a fun house mirror, with slightly distorted shapes and proportions. The illustrations are, quite simply, beautiful works of art. The story itself is an important one about the power of words and the way in which gossip spreads like a virus. A simple story, and a rather good one for children to learn early. What I missed here was the charm and sense of playfulness Madonna exhibited in her first children's book. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Young children, I'd say ages 4-9, should really enjoy this, and be enchanted by Long's pictures.","I picked this one up because I'm a Madonna fan, and I really enjoyed her storytelling in the first book The English Roses.

1,Accurate account of the life of a premier Himlayan climber,"Ed Viesturs has done a very brave thing. He has introduced the importance of safety into a world of alpha dogs all vying for the definitive issue unto the proverbial fire hydrant.""Getting up is optional, getting down is mandatory."" This is Ed's motto and is the greatest truism that could be pounded into the heads of climbers and mountaineers.I failed to get down once. I did get out however. With some help from a helicopter. I wish I would have lived by Ed's 'motto.' The mountains provide both an irresistible allure of challenge and beauty. The downside is that the environment often varies from unforgiving to deadly.This is an enjoyable read about one very sane climber and his quest to survive multiple journeys to the top of the world. Safe to add that exceptional genetics played a role.","Ed Viesturs has done a very brave thing.

0,Drifting a little too far into the esoteric,"After the challenging but successful YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT, Wilco pushes even harder on the experimentation with A GHOST IS BORN; this time the experiment is not as successful. Many songs suffer from a commitment to jarring feed beck and sonic shifts that do nothing but interrupt the melody, and lyrics that are often impenetrable in their obtuseness. Lines like, ""chambers of chains with red plastic mouths"" and ""I attack with love, pure bug beauty, curl my lips and crawl up to you,"" are left to the listener to perceive as pearls of wisdom rather than just bizarre images. Songs shift from gentle to strident without reason, other than the whim of the band. It often reminds me of Robyn Hitchcock's work, without the saving grace of humor and whimsy. I guess this was a natural extension of YHF's sensibilities, but it proves to be a fruitless one.","After the challenging but successful YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT, Wilco pushes even harder on the experimentation with A GHOST IS BORN this time the experiment is not as successful.

1,Encyclopedic and highly readable book on Special Functions,"This is one of the best books on Mathematics I have read recently;reading it gave me pleasure similar to I had felt while reading classics such as Hardy's Pure Mathematics and Titchmarsh's Theory of Functions about 30 years ago. Starting with a thorough and encyclopedic treatment of Gamma Functions , the book develops, rightly, the thesis of grandeur and ubiquitousness of Hypergeometric Functions,to then cover some of the most important special functions known today. And the beauty lies in precise,to the point, yet historically complete and 'multi-angled' as well as rigourous treatment of every topic covered, with a large number of exercises of nontrivial nature dealing successfully with details which probably could not be included in the main text because of desire to keep the size of the book within reasonable limits. Nonetheless, the authors have delightfully and almost magically been able to cover a lot of ground in a mere 600 odd pages.","This is one of the best books on Mathematics I have read recentlyreading it gave me pleasure similar to I had felt while reading classics such as Hardy's Pure Mathematics and Titchmarsh's Theory of Functions about 30 years ago.

0,"sorry, but not overly impressed","Jemima J was mostly fluff. I picked up the book and read it because I was intrigued by the cover. I read it expecting the story to have some kind of depth and the character to experience some sort of significant growth and self-acceptance...but sadly, no. I mean, the protagonist loses a ton of weight and dyes her hair golden-blonde...just so she can finally be acceptable to some hunk? The story seemed to glorify standard physical beauty and perfection and equate one's self-worth with being physically stunning. How shallow can a story be? It was a Cinderella story of sorts but not one that's credible or with a message that I necessarily liked. On the other hand, if you are looking for a light 'beach read,' then pick this one up.","Jemima J was mostly fluff. I picked up the book and read it because I was intrigued by the cover.

0,Predictable and disappointing...,"I had very high expectations for this book, based on the review and recommendation from Comso. But it was so disappointing. In this age of women finding power within, this book basically devalued it all - basic story - fat girl, no friends or men, the lust/love of her life considers her only a ""work friend"". Loses 100 pounds and becomes thin and beautiful, and has all men flocking to her, including the man who previously never gave her a second thought. The whole story focused on external beauty and how ""beautiful people"" get everything in life. There was probably a subtheme of finding power within once you realize you're already beautiful on the outside, but it was very hidden, and certainly won't be found by the women likely to read this - those looking for validation to lose weight and possibly develop eating disorders, thinking it will solve all of life's problems.","I had very high expectations for this book, based on the review and recommendation from Comso.

0,NO NO NO!!!!!!!!,"I bought this thinking it was a ""real"" super audio cd player, boy was I wrong!!! The ONLY difference between this player's reading of the Sacd and Cd layer is that the Sacd area allows more information than the cd layer, otherwise this player gives you no real difference in sound between the two. It took me a long time to realize I was fooling myself into thinking that I was really enjoying Sam Cooke's ""Portrait Of A Legend"" SACD the way it was supposed to be heard. I have been doing a lot of research and found out a player has to have 24bit/192khz DAC capability to even begin to enjoy the SACD layer and this player does not use that method to produce playback of SACD.(If you're on a budget make sure you look for that in the techinal analysis) Once again this is NOT for anyone who wants to hear the true beauty of SACD. I am now about to purchase the Marantz SA8260 SACD player.

0,Average at Best!!!!,"This book is completely useless to anyone trying to recreate these looks. There is not a single color photograph or even a color diagram to refer to. In fact, this book is completely black and white. As a professional makeup artist it is quite simple for me to look at a face and recreate it, however, any novice would have no guidance with this book. There is no way for someone to know what colors or products were used. With descriptions like ""Product Used: Lipstick"" I find it hard to believe that anyone would find much use for this. Some of the recipes in the back of the book are interesting, but I find it somewhat irresponsible that they were reproduced in this book- many of them are just plain dangerous and with so many young girls getting into makeup sooner, I fear they may try to recreate these products.","This book is completely useless to anyone trying to recreate these looks.

However, her sophomore album is extremely disappointing, to say the least. the songs aren't melodic, but bland, boring, and overly produced.

1,Fabulous but brief and not chronological,"After seeing this fabulous movie I knew I HAD to have this score! The music is delightful and full of fantasy and beauty. My main bones to pick are that the tracks are aranged haphazardly, and that many fabulous pieces are missing! I have my fingers crossed for another album ""MORE music from Peter Pan"" but sadly I doubt this will be a reality.Favorite pieces are definitly ""Fairy Dance"", ""Set Them Free"", ""I Do Believe in Fairies"", and ""Peter Returns"".James Newton Howard is also the composer of Atlantis:The Lost Empire by Walt Disney Studios, and as with all noted composers, traces of his previous work appear in his current (this is not a bad thing!)","After seeing this fabulous movie I knew I HAD to have this score!

1,Ice leads to fire.,"Perhaps had I seen ""Le Samourai"" before the film it inspired, John Woo's ""The Killer"", I would have been more impressed. Alain Delon's Jeff Costello is cold, an automaton, and it is left as an exercise to the viewer to imagine the depths of suffering which might have caused a man to turn to ice. By contrast, Chow Yun-Fat's John Chow is warm, human in his joy and suffering and, in my opinion, a more well-rounded and interesting character.If you are interested in the history of film this is definitely one to watch; its impact on later films is undeniable. As a matter of sheer film euphoria though, ""The Killer"" (especially the uncut version) is much more satisfying in its depth and beauty.","Perhaps had I seen Le Samourai before the film it inspired, John Woo's The Killer, I would have been more impressed.

0,This book has very little valuable information,"After purchasing Pamela Ferrell's book Let's Talk Hair, I decided to buy this one for more styling options. I was suprised to see the horrible lack of information for hair care and hair styling. This book provides no information on a maintenance regime, the hair products section goes into great detail on all the chemicals and ingredients in products but doesn't tell how to choose products or what products on the market are good, and the styling section has little information for home styling. The author goes into great detail on hair makeup and on what actually is in hair products along with a very detail nutritional guide on all the ingredients in food. The hair styling section is basically about popular braiding styles and a few natural styles like the 'fro and the twist out 'fro, and some information on locking. Overall, don't waste your money or time on this book.","After purchasing Pamela Ferrell's book Let's Talk Hair, I decided to buy this one for more styling options.

1,Diet,"Despite a lacklustre set of DVD extras, and a better-value boxed set, this is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films. Influential enough to spawn a genre of itself (even today, certain films are 'a bit like Die Hard'), this film combined the '70s disaster movie with a fashionable set of chic european bad guys and a plot which saw a lone hero use wit, courage and an MP5 to defeat a numerically-superior opposing force. Put like that, the film sounds merely adequate, but the beauty is in the execution - 'Die Hard' is polished. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that, after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale. It took Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John McClane character. Only Willis' hair and the awful, awful trailer have dated from 1988.","Despite a lacklustre set of DVD extras, and a better-value boxed set, this is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films.

1,The Dr. of entertainment,"You must have a good understanding of humor and satire to watch this movie. Kubrick is very delicate with the material and satire, not as discreet as American Psycho or as openly funny as American Beauty, but this movie has a dark bite to it that can keep you laughing on 4th, 5th, and 6th viewings. I am currently getting ready for sevenths. This film has 2 great reasons to admire Peter Sellers, a couple of great reasons to applaud the serious Slim Pickens and of course the marvelous George C Scott. This is a movie that only gets better with age and launched a new face for comedy. A must buy for a lover of film, comedy, and war.","You must have a good understanding of humor and satire to watch this movie.

0,The only thing worth seeing in this movie is...,"Nope, not the acting. It's the car. This is by far the worst of the last three Bond films. The acting by all the main characters seems either flat or out of place. Especially Denise Richards. Horrible casting job there...As for the action sequences, they aren't unique or interesting enough to distance themselves from other Hollywood action flicks. Maybe it is just me, but I really think that the entire franchise needs to re-invent itself. Again, if you must watch the movie, look for the new BMW Z8. That thing is a work of beauty and easily steals all the scenes it is involved in...","Nope, not the acting. It's the car. This is by far the worst of the last three Bond films.

1,Writings by Serge Kozlovsky,"Rodrigo Rodriguez' music is fully meditative. ""Across the East"" is a smooth flight on the wings of a fresh wind to mysterious eastern lands.

Sometimes listening to Rodrigo Rodriguez' music reminds me of the best Windham Hill Records' works, but this musician has his own style which can't be compared with anyone. And so much beauty is in Rodrigo Rodriguez' music!As you sit, you listen to this music and you simply become one with yourself. You stay in the present moment and you don't want to leave it.

0,Overblown egos and machismo gone awry,"This salute to white trash machismo stars Mickey Rourke (looking like a cosmetic surgery experiment gone wrong) as Harley Davidson, a motorcycle mechanic/nomad and Don Johnson, in a well-modulated performance as a has-been rodeo rider named Marlboro Man.

1,Perfect combo,"I'd heard about this book before it came out, and was excited to see it how somebody could picture a scene that for me was always intensely private, almost dreamlike. The result is everything I hoped for-not cheap or embarrassing, but erotic, evocative and provoking. Before I saw the book, I wondered about spending so much on something that was probably going to live with the porn magazines stashed under my bed. But this book is art, and I'm proud to have it in the open so that my friends can also enjoy these beautiful photographs, which take gay moments that are usually only discussed in sensationalist terms and capture the fleeting beauty, and often near-silent power.

I had never watched a Virgina Mayo movie before. She was pretty, funny, and had a great singing voice. Maude Eburne was convincing as the landlady of the inn. She was just creepy enough to be funny. However, it was Walter Brennan as Featherhead who stole the show. He played a crazy pirate, who was smarter than he looked. I do not want to write more and possible divulge spoilers.The makeup and costumes were just beautiful, especially the governor's clothes. The sets at times were a little phony, but not too bad considering that this movie was made in 1944.Overall this movie was good and I would watch it again. I give it three and three quarters stars.","This movie was not what I would call laugh out loud funny, but I did giggle a few times and it made me smile a often.Bob hope as the cowardly vaudevillian was naturally funny, as expected.

When they do, it feels tacked on and does not connect with what has happened up til that point. Although, what has happened is a quandry. The story derails after the first 30 mins. and after that all you get is boobs and blood with no pupose. The ending scene is a direct rip of ""Jesus wept"" from the original Hellraiser, but done poorly.

1,Sharp Cover Invites Content Inspection,"Years ago, a personal care product advertised that ""you never get a second chance to make a first impression."" Without a doubt, this applies also to book design. A well-designed cover can make or break a book when it comes to that all-important ""first impression."" I am attracted to covers that catch my eye, rivet my attention, and pull me into the content. The crisp, appealing cover of Longs Peak does exactly that. An additional perk is the topographical map on the back, which adds both interest and contrast. Why is this important? I'm not a climber. But I love the majesty of the peaks and the challenge of their presence. As a non-climber, however, I need to be enticed into opening--and perhaps purchasing--a book that focuses on a sport in which I do not engage. On the other hand, I relish the history and the rugged beauty of Colorado's magnificent peaks. Many thanks to the designer who invited me to explore Paul Nesbit's extraordinary world of Longs Peak.","Years ago, a personal care product advertised that you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

Alot of the historical information was a little too heavy and dry for my taste. When is the book on eye shadow coming out?","I'm mixed. I kind of liked this book.

0,A more realistic view of a masterpiece,"You don't need any reviews - yes, even including mine. The author is gifted, his style is magical realism, his substance true. It's difficult to explain Garcia Marquez to someone who has never read him, I did not care for him after reading my first story (in a scholastic course) ""The Very Old Man With Enormous Wings"" - my first trip with the man. Since I came to an understanding the simplicity and beauty has blown me away. I highly recommend ""One Hundred Years Of Solitude,"" ""Love and Other Demons"" ... anything you can get your hands on by Garcia Marquez - he speaks of the human condition, including not in the least, their dreams.","You don't need any reviews - yes, even including mine.

0,A film in search for an ending.,"...Forget the mystery, Mulholland Dr is about the character development of an innocent and pretty girl from rural Ontario who turns into a lascivious lesbian lover. Her object of affection is an auburn haired beauty that is suffering from amnesia (so much for avante garde story telling) and obviously in some trouble. The film starts with a relatively sound theme of suspense, and this is the story line that is never developed. There are numerous outtakes (for lack of a better description), which are quite audacious, sharp and theatrical. The acting is good. The ending confirms what you might suspect mid way through the film that the whole thing is dysfunctional. And just in case you aren't aware of the genre the ending fades to black, really.","...Forget the mystery, Mulholland Dr is about the character development of an innocent and pretty girl from rural Ontario who turns into a lascivious lesbian lover.

1,Graceful and intriguing,"Maybe it's because I have been working to hard and felt starved for a novel, but I read this novel in one sitting. I decided to read it before Chevalier's more well-known works, to get a taste for her work, and I really enjoyed it. The two stories (one story, really, as we come to learn) were told with grace and a touching, poignant beauty. The cynic in my scoffed at some of the metaphysical connections, the shared dreams, the french psalms-- but then the romantic and mystic in me gave in.

1,Profound,"I became aware of The Prophet when Bob Dylan mentioned it in his book Chronicles Vol. 1. Since then the book has been in the back of my mind, but I did not actively search for it. About a week ago I found an old hardcover copy of the book at my house, and remembering Bob Dylan's praise of it, I decided to give it a shot.The book itself is an easy read at 96 pages. But the cliche phrase ""quality over quantity"" comes to mind here as Gibran manages to load the book with morals and truisms to live life by. Gibran sees life and the world for all its beauty and his way of expressing and sharing his beliefs is absolute perfection.","I became aware of The Prophet when Bob Dylan mentioned it in his book Chronicles Vol. 1.

0,Very cheap scent,"I got this one because I saw people talking about it in a beauty forum and they recommended it as a nice citrus scent. Boy, aren't they wrong... Not only I don't smell anything citrusy, the scent also smells very cheap, and teenagery. If you are used to the designer brand types of perfumes like me, don't even bother to try this out. So I think this is on me to trust those recommendations online so easily.And the worst part, you can't even return it, because Amazon lists this as hazardous material, therefore you can't return it. Definitely lesson learned on my part...","I got this one because I saw people talking about it in a beauty forum and they recommended it as a nice citrus scent. Boy, aren't they wrong...

1,luxurious,"I had gone to Vancouver Island several years ago and discovered Lush cosmetics. I was so excited when I saw that Amazon started carrying Lush products and I ordered them immediately. The bath bomb was phenomenal. The sex bath bomb was absolutely perfect. The scent was amazing without being overpowering and it made my skin feel so silky and soft. I also liked that Lush sent me samples of some of their other products to try out, I will most definitely order this particular bath bomb again and again, and I will recommend it to all my friends. I can't say enough about it! It makes you feel like a princess and you never want to leave the tub! It's most definitely a keeper!!!","I had gone to Vancouver Island several years ago and discovered Lush cosmetics.

1,The Best Brunetti,"I found this Brunetti mystery less murky and more straightforward than most of the others in this series, despite the title. It's fascinating to get out to Murano and learn how the Venetian glass industry works, in a remarkably low-tech, individual workshops way. Leon's concerns about the environment continue to be a theme, counterbalanced by the beauty of Venice in the Spring. So it's one of my favorite of the Brunetti books, and I highly recommend it.","I found this Brunetti mystery less murky and more straightforward than most of the others in this series, despite the title.

1,THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY WORTH IT,"I was delighted to see that L. Cohen had a new album out. People that dont like this album either don't like Leonard Cohen because they don't get it, or are very boring people who can only enjoy granola music of the slower tempo Dead Can Dance variety. Go No More A Roving, Because of, and Undertow are extremely fine songs that make this album a must. I don't see how anyone with a heart can not fully appreciate Undertow for the beauty that it is. Because of is also a very sexy song. The other songs are quite good as well.I would also definately recommend TEN NEW SONGS, for those of you who quit buying his albums after the FUTURE. It is every bit as important and sexy as the Future and Im Your Man. This guy knows how to pick his back up singers.","I was delighted to see that L. Cohen had a new album out.

0,mediocre adult contemporary,"Ok...maybe I am just getting old myself, but I listen to this album and I get sleepy. Annie's voice is always great, but there is no real energy on this album. Yes, bands change etc..but just because you change doesn't mean you have to get stale. The beauty in The Eurythmics was their blend of the aesthetics of New Wave with the soulfulness of R & B. Most of the older Eurythmics albums had a ""concept"", from the soundtrack to 1984, to Savage, this album just lingers, with no direction; just dull.","Ok...maybe I am just getting old myself, but I listen to this album and I get sleepy.

1,RECOMMENDED VIEWING,"I love Cheryl Ladd, plus war and romantic movies, putting these three together gave a great little story to watch.It is an old 1980's movie but still has lost none of its modern day appeal.I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to escape to a bit of nostalgia, the story line is excellent and Cheryl's beauty and talent shines through.","I love Cheryl Ladd, plus war and romantic movies, putting these three together gave a great little story to watch.It is an old 1980's movie but still has lost none of its modern day appeal.I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to escape to a bit of nostalgia, the story line is excellent and Cheryl's beauty and talent shines through."
1,He hits the nail on the head,"This isn't the easiest of reads, but it's worth picking up. The author basically argues that humans have tried to usurp God's place, and then shows how this ""cosmic takeover"" pans out in three areas: truth, beauty, and goodness. I especially like the way the author discusses how Godlusters think they're the source of all truth. A timely discussion for a day and age that thinks all truth is subjective. My only problem with the book is that it's difficult to follow in places. Walters is a philosopher, and sometimes he (she?) is a little technical. That's why I give it four stars instead of five.","This isn't the easiest of reads, but it's worth picking up.

0,Lethargic psycho-sexual drama,"An aging female British writer meets -- or possibly imagines -- her publisher's sexually liberated daughter at the publisher's country home in the South of France. Nice photography and decent acting but the first half of the movie unfolds at an agonizingly slow pace, and the ending is muddled at best. You can't even call it a trick ending; it's more of a ""what really happened?"" ending ... and you don't really care!Ludivine Sagnier, the young French actress who plays Julie, is quite an erotic beauty and steals the show from tight-lipped Charlotte Rampling as the older woman. In fact, IMHO she's the only reason to watch this lethargic movie.","An aging female British writer meets -- or possibly imagines -- her publisher's sexually liberated daughter at the publisher's country home in the South of France.

1,Cure to lost youth,"This magnificent album encapsulates all the vibrance, vitality and beauty of 70's reggae.

1,A must see for any fan (and informative for the crazy non-fans too!),"I fall in love with Disney animated features everytime I watch this documentary. While it does focus a lot on the drama and power struggle that the Disney company fell victim to in the 80's, it also gives you glimpses into the life and struggles of a Disney animator and the creative process of the studio at the time. Even more importantly, you get to see some great behind the scenes footage of Howard Ashman at work. Who, even 20 years after his passing, inspires me to get off my ass and do someting creative when I see the passion he had for his art. If you were a kid in 1989 and grew up through the Disney decade, you'll especially love this film, but I promise, there is a little something for everyone in ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"" or as I like to call it ""Disrupting the Pretty Napper"" ;)","I fall in love with Disney animated features everytime I watch this documentary.

0,Catwoman: Grade C,"Catwoman is a blend of comic book style set direction, music video atmosphere, and special effects. Halle Berry is not her usual self in a very bad way. Her acting was average, and I felt and in some parts of the movie I think she felt that she wasn't doing her best. The story was a little stupid, however it wasn't unstructured. The big mistake the screenwriters took was separating her from Selina Kyle, the villainous woman from the Batman films. The movie would've generated a bigger following had the film taken place in Gotham city. Sharon Stone also makes a comeback role reprising the evil murderous woman she plays so well. Another thing about the film is that Catwoman is saving the world from poisonous beauty products, which is not a relatable fear. This film in no means will make people cringe when they pass the makeup counter at a department store. All in all, this film was fun to watch but lacked in uniqueness and class.","Catwoman is a blend of comic book style set direction, music video atmosphere, and special effects.

1,Love sophia's vision,The virgin Suicides is such a good movie. The subject of course is a little grim but the way its filmed is so dreamy and beautiful. You get lost in this world for a little while and leaves you with questions but not in a bad way. Sophia Coppola has a way with films that gets me every time. American Beauty is also along the same lines except to me a little more complex. The characters are a little more developed and you get everything by the end of the movie.,The virgin Suicides is such a good movie.

1,Great Interview Disc,"I think that this is a must have for any Kiss fan. It is a personal interview with Gene Simmons from 1987. He discusses his views on a reunion tour, having his own record label, and describing what it would be like if Kiss came out in 1987 with makeup (with Eric Carr on drums, and Bruce Kullick on lead guitar). Gene also talks about the new album released at that time ""Crazy Nights"". He mentions how he thinks it could be the best album yet and he says it's his favorite. Great interview and highly recommended for any Kiss fan.","I think that this is a must have for any Kiss fan. It is a personal interview with Gene Simmons from 1987.

0,worst 70's rock album ever,"I can't believe anyone likes this album. I didn't even know about it until a couple days ago and have just finished listening to it. Now let me clarify, I am a big fan of the original lineup and have owned Scorching Beauty for many years. I thought that album while being Iron Butterfly in name only, was a great albeit different album. It had lots of catchy songs and rocked out, and even had good ballads. This is not the follow-up I expected. It's way too commercial sounding and the slick production is a big hinderence. I did like the song Scorching Beauty but obviously that was left over from the sessions for the previous album of the same name. A big waste of time, don't bother. I bet the people who liked this album also liked the Jefferson Airplane reunion album from 89, cause that was also made for ex-hippies who no longer trip.","I can't believe anyone likes this album.

1,Deja vu,"I enjoyed this book very much but I couldn't help feeling like I had read it before. The character O is very much like Beauty of Anne Rice's erotic trilogy (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release.)I found that to be a tad annoying.O's devotion to her lover is inspiring, however I enjoyed her transformation to being completely devoted to Sir Stephen more.The only thing that really made me almost angry we are led to believe that O kill herself.I heard something about a 'part II' to this novel but I looked it up and there seemed to be one but it had nothing to do with O.","I enjoyed this book very much but I couldn't help feeling like I had read it before.

The box though is a total throw off, and doesn't nearly show the beauty of sarah michelle gellar. They should've cut a picture from an episode, and putit on the cover, as they did with faith's picture on the season three box. As stupid as u think this is, i feel strongly about it.

Jill Spiegel is such a dynamo that when I saw a video of her giving a seminar I wondered if she naturally has such a high level of energy or if she achieved it through pharmacologic manipulation.

Minus the famous name, minus the natural beauty, and minus the unfathomable energy level, could the rest of us substantially benefit from her techniques as presented in the book?

1,My favorite picture book,"I read the Japanese translation of this picture book when I was in first or second grade in elementary school. This book starts with definitions of a circle, sphere, and then it explains how people developed the idea of the round earth time to time. Drawings are very detailed and naturalistic.

1,Simply Brillant,"I saw this film today and it was the most brillant body of work that I've seen in quite some time. It just built on all the things that I already knew about Jean-Michel. The interviews were very insightful and moving. Beauty, Art, Tragedy, and Fame all wrapped into one. I loved it from start to finish.

1,the grandeur and beauty of Argentina on a DVD...,"Seeing this Globtrekker travelogue again on TV reminded me of how well it portrays the beauty and immense scale of this amazing country. It also superbly communicates the warmth and generosity of its people. Disregard another reviewer's grousings about the economic inaccuracies (yeah, so what?--it's actually much cheaper now to visit Argentina), and just sit back and enjoy sweeping views of Iguasu Falls, the Argentine cordillera, windswept Patagonia, and the Perito Moreno glacier. Justine Shapiro has just the right balance of wonder and wimsy to pull off this travelogue. I especially like her good-humored response to a pass made at her in Buenos Aires, and her imitation of a penguin walk on the beach in Patagonia. This is a real fun video and will make you want to visit this great country.","Seeing this Globtrekker travelogue again on TV reminded me of how well it portrays the beauty and immense scale of this amazing country.

1,'Welcome to the offshoots of Jupiter',"This is the Residents second full length recording that was not to be released until its creator's had completely forgotten about its existence. The theory of obscurity in full effect. It was later released by the Residents management in order to fulfill contractual obligations after the Residents had disappeared with the master tapes of 'Eskimo'-- just days before Eskimo was to be pressed. Haunting, beautiful and bizarre. A certain kind of sadness prevails through most of the album with the Residents using a 5 part tone poem to ask some questions 'guaranteed to shake you up'. The album lets us take a peek at the Residents behind the eyeball masks where they ponder their own decision to live in obscurity.'To exist to show or to be shown is a question never, never known' There is an innocence and beauty to this album that can't be understated. Absolutely essential.","This is the Residents second full length recording that was not to be released until its creator's had completely forgotten about its existence.

1,Prose by any other name...,"A canny introduction ushers the reader into this hybrid art form. The examples illuminate the form's history and variety. Most of the prose poems are superb; only a few disappoint. And readers previously unfamiliar with the genre (like myself) will likely be introduced to established but little-known writers of tremendous depth, beauty and originality, like Lyn Hejinian and Fanny Howe. I highly recommend this collection.","A canny introduction ushers the reader into this hybrid art form. The examples illuminate the form's history and variety.

1,A Refreshing Look at a Great City!,"Not only does the book serve as an aesthetic gem, but also, looking beyond the beauty of Terry Evans' photographs, the book subtly ""reveals"" Chicago's unique history as well as some of the issues facing the region. I thought the way the book was arranged to exhibit the positive, without completely neglecting the negative, was refreshingly realistic. As a native Chicagoan, I gained a new appreciation for the city and was reminded of why I have always loved living here.","Not only does the book serve as an aesthetic gem, but also, looking beyond the beauty of Terry Evans' photographs, the book subtly reveals Chicago's unique history as well as some of the issues facing the region.

0,You have to be kidding,"I bought this book with the good reader's reviews in mind. Boy was I misled. The author does know his stuff about the Lizzie Borden case but his writing and orgaanization are not up to par. Including everything there is to know about Lizzie Borden is difficult at best. The inclusion of a letter written by Lizze about her purchase of cosmetic bag does not warrant 3 pages. I finished the book with the same feeling that you get when cannot take your eyes off of a car accident. To be positive, the chronology and periodic summary of facts were very good.","I bought this book with the good reader's reviews in mind. Boy was I misled.

1,The only mascara I'll use,"I have been using this mascara for years. For some reason, I keep trying other brands, but I always come back to this one. This brand seems to hold lashes in place after curling, rather than weigh them down, which is something that I can't find in any other brand/ formula.My only complaint with this product is that it is nearly impossible to get off at the end of the day. I have to use a specific brand (Mary Kay) of eye makeup remover, and it is the ONLY thing that will get this stuff off my lashes. Otherwise I have to literally pull the makeup off with my fingertips, which isn't pleasant.I highly recommend this formula.","I have been using this mascara for years.

1,Excelente; Perfecto,"This is one of the best films of the decade: unique, passionate, brilliantly acted, directed and designed. It is a stunning masterpiece from first to last, a tribute to the magnificent painter and the superb actress who plays her. The cast is beyond great. Each plays his or her part with gusto. Selma Hayek plays with all her heart, a brave actress with rare skill and beauty. Molina is terrific, of course, as are all the players, large and small. I loved Rush as Trotsky, but the real star of this film is the director who, with her design team, has made one of the most visually stunning films of the century. It is so gratifying to see Mexico so well represented on film, so glorious in all its facets. The Kahlo house, of course, is a palace. What an enchanting little masterpiece of architecture. The music, the food, the clothing...it is a great advertisement for a life and a way of life.","This is one of the best films of the decade unique, passionate, brilliantly acted, directed and designed.

1,"Well-rounded story, intelligently executed.","Are you a discerning movie goer? Do you enjoy the medium, but dislike sex and violence? Now, do you also lament the fact that many films devoid of these two elements are also devoid of a compelling story, characters, and beauty? Look no further. This film will satisfy all your wants and needs. It feels very modern, yet is a throwback to a time when nuance and suggestion carried much more weight in a film than the latest porno/sadist blockbuster. If you desire the latter, don't look here. But if you want to see proof that a very fine movie can be made without those 'other' elements, take a chance on 'My Life So Far'.","Are you a discerning movie goer?

1,Great for the mind and the spirit,"I am fascinated by this CD, plus I really enjoy it. The mathematical puzzles it poses are fascinating. I've found myself trying to design guitar and piano keyboards with some of the more interesting tone sets (15, 19) and wondering about different ways of writing music. I'd love to see Mr. Blackwood's notebooks on musical notations.In addition, this is a lot of fun to listen to. Mr. Blackwoods compositions are sometimes a little basic, but I think he intended them that way in order to let the beauty and strangeness of these new modes just wash over us in their glory. He does a great job of tying the style of the composition to the tones that a given mode best expresses. Bravo!","I am fascinated by this CD, plus I really enjoy it.

No, this album will require that you ""listen"" and allow the album to grow on you. However, once it does it is a transforming experience. Amel is not only beautiful on the outside; this album clearly shows that she is just as beautiful on the inside. Back in the ""Groove Theory"" days before I ever saw her, she just sounded ""absolutely angelic"" but, the total package is simply beyond words.

The writing is dull and verbose, and the explanations are confusing. I feel sorry for anyone whose introduction to Calculus comes from this book.

The video quality is poor when moving fishes or shadows are displayed, jagged lines are seen as if resolution was only 240 lines instead of 480.This is quite a disappointment considering this is a production from the picture specialist IMAX.

The majority of this album lack any focus or even any artistic goals. One could say that is the beauty of it - HOGWASH, that my friends is a lame excuse for this lame excuse. Kid A gets a Kid D-.

1,I'm blown away,"Perhaps this can never compare to that of Ok Computer, but this is a masterpiece that just explains our society in a 50 minute session. I love everything about this album, however I do agree with some critics who ask ""Where are the guitars?"" It's true. Guitars are not a big part of this, and I would be extremely surprised if a Guitar Tab book ever came out for this, but that's the true beauty of it.I've listened to this album countless numbers of times, but each time, it brings another emotion to me. The riffs of strange sounds tend to stick with you, and before you know it, everything is in your head. When you walk around with it, you can see a new feeling in everything. Something else will have a new meaning. In fact, this album has changed my view of the world; it's that strong.If you can purchase one album in you lifetime, this is it!","Perhaps this can never compare to that of Ok Computer, but this is a masterpiece that just explains our society in a 50 minute session.

0,left over effects shouldnt make up an entire record!,"UNDER-achieving is back in vogue with this PRETENTIOUS - HYPED mess of an album! It is nothing close to the Bends or OK Computer - The songs (dare I call them that) have no structure. I have seen people say thats the beauty of it - Hogwash! If that were the case then nobody would even know about them, If it wasnt for albums like the Bends and Ok, then they wouldnt be in this self-absorbing position, because no-one would care.

1,Hammerin' Funk,Horace Silver has always been one of my favorite piano players. Though his styling isn't as distinct as chops of Monk Horace got some Hammerin'Funk of his own. I've always felt that this album is where is talents have been showcased the best. The album opens with his very own brand of deceptively simple Funk. Yet if it's so simple why aren't there more piano players who sound so joyous and free as Horace does on this track. Que Pasa is a fine latin effort. It sounds almost genre defining. You wanna know what Latin Jazz is. It's Que Pasa! Finaly there's lonely woman. A bop classic that listens like a song with full lyric and all. Each time you revisit this song the lyrics are different but always carry a melancholy beauty.,Horace Silver has always been one of my favorite piano players.

0,Wth is this?,i was really excited to see this movie because of the legend but this movie did not do the legend justice. There are all kinds of holes int he plot and some random characters. The characters are typical horror movie characters sitting around watching the woman kidnap and kill children. Come on!!! This was one of the worst horror movies I've seen in a long time. It gave me a good laugh with the bad makeup and mediocre plot.

0,Missing the point...,"I think she is missing the point of being a Roman Catholic. How can you practice a faith when you disagree with its main tenets? The simple answer is that you cannot. You cannot adhere to a religion when your heart is not in it. The Church rejects homosexuality, artificial birth control and women's ordination because those things are contrary to living a sanctified Catholic life (for many theological reasons which Dr. Ryan clearly is unaware of). If you want watered down theology, weak religious adherence, and a domesticated version of Jesus Christ, you are missing out on the beauty of what it really means to be a Roman Catholic.","I think she is missing the point of being a Roman Catholic.

1,Twisted fairy tales,"I had to read this book for one of my college courses and absolutly loved it. The way Carter twists the fairy tales and adds a sometimes morbid clencher is excellent. I loved the statments she was making in them and the way stories were told was excellent. As was the fact that women weren't made out to be weak or that their only rightful place was in the kitchen. Out of all the stories in the book I found ""The Tigers Bride"" (re-telling of Beauty and the Beast) and ""The Company of Wolves"" (re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood) to be my favorites.",I had to read this book for one of my college courses and absolutly loved it.

1,The thrill of a singer discovering herself,"An old girlfriend of mine, upon hearing this album, said it sounded like a woman singing to herself in her kitchen. I haven't come up with a better description since. There's an intimacy, an innocence to Sheila's singing here that is enthralling. Sheila went on to record some masterful albums -- 1977's Sheila and 1989's Lost & Found being among the best -- but it is with Portrait of Sheila that we discover a singer discovering herself. Her mirth is contagious in ""Falling in Love with Love,"" her wistful remembrances in ""When the World Was Young"" enter the listener's heart like a sigh, and her sorrows are laid out in all their blue beauty in ""I'm a Fool to Want You,"" the loveliest version of this song I have ever heard. This is an essential album for any jazz collection.","An old girlfriend of mine, upon hearing this album, said it sounded like a woman singing to herself in her kitchen.

Listening to this recording is like eavesdropping on a very deep and private conversation between two creative geniuses.One may ask, ""Why so many ballads?""

1,This Woman is a Goddess!,"I had heard about Diane Irons'incredible transformations from being in the modeling industry myself. I always wanted to go on her program, but was never able to get on her waiting list of celebrities and top models. So when Beauty Boot Camp came out, I was first in line. It's been two weeks, and I've lost 12 pounds. Plus my closet, cosmetics, kitchen all work for me, & my skin has never looked better, and this was the easiest diet I've ever been on. I took her advice and got 9 hours of sleep a night so I wouldn't eat to overcome fatigue, and I listened to Diane's motivational CD every day (sometimes morning and evening). I am so happy Beauty Boot Camp is now available to everyone, and at such a bargain price. I'm down a dress size! I love this woman!","I had heard about Diane Irons'incredible transformations from being in the modeling industry myself.

""Bendita la luz""...ah, how soothing and tranquilizing to listen to this song after a long day at work and a long sit in traffic in the Washington DC area.

1,A Solo Piano Album That Inspires,"This is such a wonderful collection of tunes from McCoy Tyner. ""Tivoli"" is a Dexter Gordon tune, relishing in the imagery of the famous Tivoli Gardens. Tyner's rendition is catchy and very lively. ""Tribute To Lady Day,"" an original by Tyner, eloquently pays homage to Billie Holliday. In ""Effendi,"" another one of Tyner's compositions, the rolling bassline of the left hand is infectious, adding even more swing. McCoy Tyner also recalls visions of his old collaboration partner, John Coltrane, by performing three Coltrane originals. The feel of Tyner playing ""After The Rain"" conjures up moments of pure beauty. The album, as a whole, is stunning. Throughout 'Soliloquy,' there are inflections of Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Bud Powell, and of course John Coltrane, showing just how much Tyner is a lover of jazz and one of the great masters and practitioners of this superb artform. This is the kind of album that makes pianists, like myself, very happy.","This is such a wonderful collection of tunes from McCoy Tyner.

1,A Lifetime on the Riverbank,"I, too, was introduced to Wind in the Willows at a very early age - around 4 - by my grandmother who read it to me over one long summer. From that summer on I understood the power and beauty of words. I loved ""the taste"" of all the big words in that book and found it so much fun to learn them. Forget all American theories of reading which simplify everything into pablum. Very young kids can deal with these ""complex-branching"" sentences and the sophisticated vocabulary, plot and character development. After 50 years of reading and teaching literature my copy of Wind in the Willows illustrated by Arthur Rackham is my treasure. I believe that Rackham was nearly completely paralyzed during the last year when he made these wonderful illustrations. A must for every child! ... and every parent who missed the experience!","I, too, was introduced to Wind in the Willows at a very early age - around 4 - by my grandmother who read it to me over one long summer.

Shepard, of course, is the wizard behind the illustrations for Winnie the Pooh, and his contribution to this volume are as significant.

1,Excellent for those who like to mix up their own,"This book is great for those who like to make things from scratch, and for those who like to know the chemical makeup of makeup! I love to know how things work, so I found this book fascinating, and the recipes simple enough to try. The only disappointment I experienced was a lack of resources. Some of the ingredients are not common, and that may discourage some from trying the recipes. In this internet age it would have been nice to have a list of internet resources that sell some of the hard to find ingredients. Even Janice Cox's website did not have a list of trustworthy internet website resources. Other than that, I would recommend this book to a friend.","This book is great for those who like to make things from scratch, and for those who like to know the chemical makeup of makeup!

It is one of those books that I fall back on when I need a comforting story to read.It follows the life of one poor dog as he moves from one master to another, and even ends up as a fighting dog at one point. Its a bit like ""Black Beauty"" I guess seeing as it follows an animals life, but white fang is more of a story. White Fang is not just some docile horse but a real wild dog that has survived where others haven't. A great read and a great story.","This is a great story that I have read many times.

Look in virtually any anthology of `world art` and you will usually look in vain for Repin, Polenov, Shishkin (the Russian Constable?), the marvellous Nikolai Ge (pronounced Gyay) whose profound religious paintings have been scandalously ignored by most critics, the great Isaac Levitan, who was Chekhov`s friend and seemed to be able to paint stillness and silence itself...and so on.You will discover riches here - a world of seemingly neglected art by masters, many the equivalent of the accepted greats of Western art. This is a book to lose oneself in. Much has been said about the `Russian soul`, but here you may well find it. A book of unexpected beauty which, along with the artists themselves, should be far better known.","This is surely one of the most unpredictable, long-overdue art books it has been my privelege to find.

When I got it out of the package There were huge scratches all over the place. Since these were just cosmetic I went ahead and charged it. It took forever! I was about to put it back in the box and ship it back when it FINALLY was done. I set in the program and started before I went to work. When I got back I looked over at the dock and was not surprised to see it wasn't there. Unlike other reviews where it got stuch under furniture, mine was just sitting there. I immediatley sent it back to amazon. The cleaning it did wasn't very good either. The only fun I got ws seeing it move before I went to work.I would not recommend this product to anyone.","After seeing good reviews and thinking of how easy it would be to just set a program and having my cleaning done I decided to buy a Roomba.

0,Not her best,"So far I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and have kept every single one of them in hardcover. I look forward to reading Impossible and Miracle soon.

1,Wonderful!,"Barbara Hendricks has a very unique light-lyric sound that is wonderful for this repertoire. Her line is never lost in her wonderful Baroque articulation.The reason I give this recording a less than perfect score, is Ms. Hendricks' tendancy to lose the beauty of her voice on an occasional single note. This may sound picky, but she has trouble with certain vowels and they tend to distract from the otherwise lovely singing making the line occasionally disjunct.","Barbara Hendricks has a very unique light-lyric sound that is wonderful for this repertoire.

1,"Very, Very Un-Patterson but still Very, Very Good","Readers of Patterson's mystery novels are not likely to enjoy this book, if they are looking for that same genre story. However, the book weaves a tale just as compelling as his more well known books. Katie has been dumped suddenly, inexplicably, and just as mysteriously, a diary shows up on her doorstep, detailing her lover's past. The more you read, the more you want to know, and this book is nearly impossible to put down. The book has been compared a lot to _Bridges_Of_Madison_County_, but it's different. I enjoyed both books, but this book was as much about the beauty of life every day, life lived simply, our every day relationships, as it was about romance. Definitely worth the read!","Readers of Patterson's mystery novels are not likely to enjoy this book, if they are looking for that same genre story.

0,Completely useless as a primer,"If you want a product that keeps your eyeshadow from collecting in the crease of your eyelid, this is totally useless. It's a nice eyeshadow, but it doesn't work at all as a ""base"" or ""primer."" Honestly, I get worse crease lines with it than without it and will be returning it to the Clinique counter post-haste. If your problem is smudging your eyemakeup, maybe it helps. Couldn't tell you. But for me, it didn't do remotely what it was supposed to do and looked terrible within an hour.","If you want a product that keeps your eyeshadow from collecting in the crease of your eyelid, this is totally useless.

0,"Review of ""The Lost Plates of Wilford Eng"" by Thomas Orton","It is ironic. Some books have great themes but get written about with little substance. Others are written with great beauty and poetry but have nothing to say.This book is of the former.Wilford Eng was a wonderful photographer. Of this, there can be no doubt. However, Orton seems to be playing upon the Eng unknowns or created unknowns so he can have something to make up for his lack of imagination. Otherwise, why would he pack his book with erotic sex and the like? If it is not sex that he is writing about then he digs up betrayal at every other dark corner of his almost literature of third rate porn.Now, all this may be excused if we, the reader comes away with a better understanding of himself, circumstance and philosophy. Don't hold your breath as you will not. The only reason for holding your breath is to stop the bad smell of a rotten novel and time wasted reading it.","It is ironic.

1,A Good if Odd Transition,"The Pixies are my favourite band, hands down. I'd like to get my opinion about that out here first, and say why this album didn't get five stars. Before this, the Pixies were energetic, edgy and somewhat raw, all the way. After this (Trompe le Monde) they still had the same energy, but with a more complex sound and more beauty. The theme changed too, from incest and bodily harm to spacy weirdness. Bossanova seems to be the crossroad, and pulls it off nicely, but not perfectly. Some of the songs are excellent, like Velouria, Cecila Ann, Blown Away and Havalina. Other songs though...not so good. (Stormy Weather, a very boring song, comes to mind) That's probably the only flaw with this cd, is some songs are boring because they drag too much. I do enjoy this album though, and listen to it frequently. Anyone getting into the Pixies should first check out Surfer Rosa or Dolittle, then Trompe le Monde, and then finally get around to this little gem.","The Pixies are my favourite band, hands down.

1,Really Funny,"Beauty and the beast takes a turn for the worse with this ugly bust by cult writer-director Hal Hartley. When the timid Sarah Polley hoofs it to Iceland to confront her boyfriend's (literally) monstrous murderer, Robert John Burke, the two strike up an unlikely and uneasy friendship. So, Polley brings the horned creature to New York (shades of King Kong?), where her boss, tabloid TV producer Helen Mirren, wants to make him a star. Hartley's meditation on society's obsession with conformity and celebrity is intermittently engaging, but the relentlessness with which he drives home his points quickly jangles the nerves. Only the most dyed-in-the-wool Hartley fans will find this monster a ball.","Beauty and the beast takes a turn for the worse with this ugly bust by cult writer-director Hal Hartley.

0,Far from Baez's greatest folk material!,"Despite many positive recommendations of this album, I do not like the material, the singing and the accompaniment. As a folk aficionado, I prefer Baez's true folk singing, especially when she accompanies herself on the guitar. There she really shines. Her contemporary material lacks the power and beauty of her earlier folk singing.","Despite many positive recommendations of this album, I do not like the material, the singing and the accompaniment.

0,Really rates a zero,"This book fails to recognize that Revelation is not a prediction of our times, but intead, the Revelation of Jesus Christ was written to a specific Christian community - the Christian community of 100 A.D. in Asia Minor (Turkey).The dispensationalism of this book does a real diservice to the meaning of Revelation. The message of Revelation for all times, is not to worship anything or anybody but God/Jesus. Revelation is not about the end times.If you really want to read some good books on Revelation, read Fiorenza's Revelation: Vision of a Just World or Unveiling Empire:Revelation Then and Now.Reading Revelation for the Biblically Inept really made me sad.

0,Don't chop 'Where The Streets...',"Like many of the other reviews, I don't agree with the track listing, as well. Four songs from 'Rattle And Hum' are too many, and the albums 'Boy' and 'October' are completely under-represented. The new single, 'The Sweetest Thing' is thoroughly disposable; it sounds like filler. And I despise the edited version of 'Where The Streets Have No Name'. This is the song that got me into U2 in the first place, and I believe the guitar lead-in and the matching guitar fade-out at the end are the most magnificent guitar pieces The Edge has played in any of U2's music. To cut both ends of the song short like the edit version does is nothing short of a tragedy. Usually, you would recommend a greatest hits collection to a friend who was just starting to get into a group, as an introduction to their music. I would not, however, recommend this collection. It is not a true representation of the beauty and brilliance that is U2.","Like many of the other reviews, I don't agree with the track listing, as well.

1,MMM - Manech aime Mathilde - Manech loves Mathilde,"Movie is set in France near the end of WWI. Mathilde, a young woman who contracted polio at young age, sets out to find her childhood sweetheart and fiancé - most believe that he is killed in action while she refuses to believe so and she sets out to investigate. Her fiancé was one of five wounded French soldiers who were heartlessly abandoned by their own troops and left to die in the fields between the French and German armies. Spectacular cinematography and storytelling which shifts scenes from the past to the present - from the horrors of war in deadly trenches and battlefields - to the beauty of young love, passion and romance - to picturesque scenes in fields, cemeteries and villages in France. Terrific movie.","Movie is set in France near the end of WWI.

1,"Beyond worthiness, and into respectibility? Say it ain't so!","This album is a lot more honest (and a lot more fun) than 'Psycho Circus' for a number of different reasons. The production is minimal, the songs hold up much better, and the attitude of the band is positive. At this point the reunion tour was not yet a reality, but here we have a bunch of guys who pretty much wanted to just play some music and get their point across, which (for the most part) they did. The only reason I fail to give it a 5-star recommendation is for the excess of ballads. ""I Still Love You"" could have been left off; ditto ""Beth"" (sorry, PC fans--they could have done ""Hard Luck Woman"" instead). But the requisite makeup-era tunes are the ones that hold up the best, especially ""See You Tonight"": Gene's nod to early ""Yes it Is"" Beatles material. Good stuff.","This album is a lot more honest and a lot more fun than 'Psycho Circus' for a number of different reasons.

The finish is nice and it's a nice neutral color.Otherwise - terrible. The napkins randomly come out in chunks of 10 or more. This problem is worse when there are only a few napkins left in the holder - sometimes pulling on one causes every napkin to come out with it. It doesn't seem to matter what brand of napkins I use. I can't believe that this product has such great reviews here. Yes, the napkins all stand up straight even when there's just a few left - but that seems like a cosmetic feature more than anything else.

1,"Hot boys, hot imports, what more could a girl ask for?","Let's be honest. A movie with Vin Deisel & Paul Walker? It drums up reactions of Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), James Van Der Beek and Scott Caan (Varsity Blues). I happen to feel as though they were all great performances, but beauty sometimes out ways credibility. Regardless of how hot the stars in this movie were, they proved that they could pull off a pretty good flick. It did have it's cheese factors (Paul Walker spining the Supra to a hault, firing two shots and taking care of the bad guy) but the cheese was far out weighed by the non stop action.

1,They were are and will always be CREAM,"One of the most articulate reviews about the Cream Reunion DVD posted anywhere can be found on Amazon by Mr. Packer. He points out that the reason for the reunion is not important, it's all about the music.Since many Cream fans were not around for the original genius and for decades it looked like we could never witness one of the best bands ever, this would be worth any price to own.The beauty of the music is Eric/Jack/Ginger are not going through the motions. The energy level is high, there is fun in their eyes, and with all the health issues Jack Bruce in his 60's still has vocal pipes that can move a mountain.I went down to the crossroads and think I'll stay for awhile.Thanks to a power trio that has made my life fuller.","One of the most articulate reviews about the Cream Reunion DVD posted anywhere can be found on Amazon by Mr. Packer.

1,An inside peek into history and art,"Griet was a subtle, quiet and sometimes submissive girl. You will follow her as she tries to bring honor and money to her family. While blessed with a strange beauty that men take to she still seems unaware of her power as a women, perhaps because the women she lives with as servant are so demanding and cruel. This book is a very subtle read. I read it with a book club and the different points we picked up on were amazing. If you're looking for a book to discuss, this one will fit the bill. Never offensive, always touching, sometimes even leaving you begging for soemthing more to happen between this girl and the people in her life, paticularily her master Vermeer, this is a great story. Much detail is given to the paintings and the manner in which they were painted, so I recommend you read with a book on Vermeer close by. You will learn something about art, human nature, and even a bit on the historical class structure.","Griet was a subtle, quiet and sometimes submissive girl.

1,Most beautiful piece of soundtrack ever - The Love Theme,"I must confess to the world that this is my most favourite sound theme that I have ever heard in my life. The title ""The Love Theme"" is most appropriate for a piece of music of such grandeur and beauty, something which I am sure many listeners would agree.Forgive me if I may sound a little too exaggerated here, but very few music has struck such a chord in the heart as this particular piece. So simple, so soft, yet majestically grandeur and beautiful! I give my salute to the composer. Bravo!","I must confess to the world that this is my most favourite sound theme that I have ever heard in my life.

1,Beauties from the Golden Age of Hollywood,"It seems James Parish churns out far too many books. However, his series of books dealing with films and stars of the Golden period of Hollywood are absolutely indispensible for movie buffs.Anyone old enough to remember the old (now defunct) film magazine, ''Films in Review'', will recall the magazine's monthly career article on stars which covered their films in detail. The article was followed by a filmography and many photos.The Hollywood Beauties is in similar vein. It covers the careers of female stars renowned for their beauty - stars like Dolores Del Rio, Kay Francis, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Lana Turner.The great thing about this book is that all of the stars' films are covered in detail along with details about their personal lives (each chapter is like a mini book). At the end is a detailed filmography and a section on photos.Anyone interested in old stars should immediately add this great book to their library.","It seems James Parish churns out far too many books.

1,What do you expect?,"The book? No, this is a movie - a completely different medium for getting this wonderful story by Peter Hoeg across to the masses - and who wouldn't want to? When I first saw that there was a movie of this - my favorite read of the last ten years - i was initially disappointed; but it seems as if director Bille August understood the limitations here and looked instead at what he could portray in a movie that can't be portrayed as effectively in a book - the wonderous beauty of the greenlandic landscape, the haunting innocence of a deaf Isiah and the domineering power of snow, ice and water - the concurrent themes throughout this story. No, nothing will beat the book (does it ever?) especially in terms of the prose Hoeg uses, but this as close to relaying the original writing as it can be. I would like for everyone to know this incredible story, and if they won't read it, why not show them the movie?","The book?

Used built in unit in Mercedes 300E and it has larger screen and all but it was very expensive option. Beauty of this device based on pocked pc is that you can take it with you anywhere! Set up was simple but noticed that map is bit outdated as noted by other reviewers.GPS at times took a while to lock on but once it locked stayed the course. And placing it on windshied meant I don't have to take my eye off too.I'd give 4 only due to the outdated map.,Purchased it from something like out post.com  for 299.I'm happy with it especially for the price paid.

Then I read the intro by Neruda which was a thing of beauty.I read the English ""translation"" of the first couple of poems and was again dismayed. Then I started comparing the Spanish and decided that there were MANY phrases which seemed to be odd translations. At first I thought that I was just unaccustomed to translated poetry but the more I read the more sure I was that the translations were off. I too was surprised that despite my limited Spanish and lack of prior exposure to Neruda I could immediately tell that the translations were bizarre. I described this to my family and finally started checking other people's responses on line and I am relieved to find that I was not alone.

1,THE LAST PRAIRIE brought back memories and taught me much. What a sweet peaceful read.,"I loved this fine little book about the Nebraska Sandhills. I became interested in that area after reading Mari Sandoz' books some years back then reading some of them again this year. This book, ""The Last Prairie"", has added to that knowledge regarding Nebraska. I also traveled through that area some years back and liked it very much.Since I am a Texan and lived in the Sandhills area of Texas for 25 years, I developed a love of the prairies and deserts with sandhills. Since we made the mistake of moving back to the High Plains of Texas I have missed that part of the state very much, and still enjoy reading about the special beauty of the sandhills and its flora and fauna in other parts of the country.I recommend THE LAST PRAIRIE; A SANDHILLS JOURNAL very highly for it knowledge, its warmth, and the good research.

1,FAST AS A SHARK!,"Accept and Judas Priest were arguably the biggest influences on the NWOBHM and speed metal in general, and I must say Restless and Wild is one of those albums that will make you forget who is in the room and incite random headbanging sessions. There are no pompous jaggoffs attempting to show off or expand your mind here... just pure 100% HEAVY METAL.Fast as a Shark and the title track kick things off with a back to back speed metal assault.. Udo sounds like a constipated granny, of course, but that's the beauty of it all. There are a few slower, hard rock oriented numbers (move your head, neon nights) but they rock hard all the same.I have never worn leather/studs in my life... this album makes me want to.

1,The Proper Care of Dr. Laura,"I think Doc Laura has written some fabulous books. And this is just one of many. The beauty is, each book it a tiny bit different so you really get a good morsal of truth in each one if you read it really really carefully. In this book, I've learned how to not have my husband leave me, and really, isn't that a pretty important thing? Especially when you have children!!!! You have a responsibility towards your children and the thing is, I'm my kid's mom so I especially have a responsibility. It doesn't really matter who the real baby daddy is it's just important who's watching them now. And you don't want to lose that man.

1,more filling and tastes great,"With this addition George's series takes up residence in your soul as well as your heart. If you're a new reader, start with A Great Deliverance, rather than the prequel, A Suitable Vengeance. You don't have to read them in order, but it's a good idea. In this book (like the last, Deception On His Mind), it is not Lynley and his friends who provide counterpoint to the mystery. As much as we like them, this is not a bad thing, although it may account for the seemingly slow start. But the several interwoven stories require no familiar backdrop. Once you're engaged, Olivia's tale brings enough beauty, mystery and pathos to etch her story into your soul. Read the other reviews. Even better, read the book.","With this addition George's series takes up residence in your soul as well as your heart.

1,Where did this great movie come from?,"This is a great little movie from England, though it stars Thora Birch (Lester's daughter from American Beauty). I won't give away the story, only to say that it takes a completely different tack to the material - one that echoes Kurosawa's Rashomon, if you know to what I am referring.I have to say that, while I wasn't overly taken by Birch in American Beauty, here she does a phenomenal job with some VERY demanding material. Let's just say her character isn't as simple as it may seem in the beginning. And the supporting cast is also very good (it doesn't hurt that Kiera Knightley is a dead ringer for Natalie Portman, and was used to that effect in The Phantom Menace). The film is beautifully shot, and the DVD's image does it good justice.","This is a great little movie from England, though it stars Thora Birch Lester's daughter from American Beauty.

1,"Caught in ""The Trap""","I saw this movie one late night on TV in the early 70's while living in NYC. The image of Eve and Jean La Bete discovering themselves set against the Northwest wilderness never left me. Over the years this movie kept creeping back into my head like few other movies have. It is not the best produced movie ever made, but it tells a story that is unique, simple and compelling. Reed brings a ""bull in the chinashop"" masculinity to the character Jean La Bete that at first conflicts with, but then blends with the very subtle beauty and inner strength of Eve, played perfectly and silently by Rita Tushingham. (Tushingham also plays the adult daughter of Laura and Dr. Zhivago in Dr. Zhivago.)I didn't see ""The Trap"" again until a few years ago when I came across a cheap used copy online. This is a very unusual love story. ""The Trap"" might catch you like it did me years ago.","I saw this movie one late night on TV in the early 70's while living in NYC.

1,Mesmerizing and atmospheric despite the nonlinear story,"This book was recommended by a friend on a hiking trip to Alberta, Canada this summer. I suspect the story is greatly enhanced if the reader has been to Jasper National Park and the memory of the park and its icefields are still fresh, or better yet is reading the book while surrounded by Jasper's awesome display of natural beauty and power. Many of the places are supposedly fictional, but easily recognizable even to a visitor. It deepened the story for me.I found the book mesmerizing and atmospheric, partly because of the nontraditional, nonlinear, somewhat moody style of storytelling. But that is the same quality that bothered my husband so prospective readers will need to judge for themselves.","This book was recommended by a friend on a hiking trip to Alberta, Canada this summer.

Caring in Remembered Ways is just such a book, the kind you can read from cover to cover or leave on your nightstand for those final, meditative thoughts before sleep. The throne room is also a good place for such pondering in a moment of privacy  relaxation.A simply beautiful inspirational book of verses, thoughts, stories  philosophies."
1,Waters of March,"Heard ""Waters of March"" while driving to visit a friend with cancer. It was the most glorius spring day on the backroads of Sonoma, CA, with green hills, bright sun and wildflowers. Listening to Susannah McCorkle's simple interpretation of this lyric, I burst into tears, from joy, I think. The song captures beauty and death, hand-in-glove.","Heard Waters of March while driving to visit a friend with cancer.

His quest to rescue the Egg of the Pheonix takes him through worlds of beauty and adventure. proving that the Glory Road "" ..is paved not with stones, but with boulders.""

1,Wow,"What a beautiful album. Definitely one of my all-time favorites and one of the best rock and roll albums of all time. Every time I listen to Who's Next, I am overwhelmed by the sheer emotion and power of the album. Each song is spectacular in its own right and together, the compilation makes for a masterpiece. Although Who's Next has personal significance for me and I could rave on and on about it forever, even if you're not a Who fan, you should check it out. Who's Next is not only a testament to the beauty and power of rock and roll but to that of music in general.","What a beautiful album.

1,NICE SURPRISE,"This little, quiet movie has a charming, melancholy soul, and it has subtle things to say about who we love, and why. I found every performance in this movie to be almost heartbreakingly real, and the small, intimate scenes between people to be poignant, and well-observed. Colin Farrell has never been quite as appealing, and his beauty has never been put to better use as a sweet, winsome, soulful boy looking for love, family and happiness. Despite a few movie cliches, this movie surprised me and made me want to see it again, and again. It boasts a delightful soundtrack of chestnuts, atypical and non-commerical, incluidng a few tracks by poet-songstress Laura Nyro, whose own version of her song ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" will have you immediately looking for the soundtrack (it's not on it; you'll need to get her one of her own CD collections, which are easy enough to find). Enjoy, and make sure you've got a Kleenex handy!","This little, quiet movie has a charming, melancholy soul, and it has subtle things to say about who we love, and why.

0,This was sooooo bad,"I mainly wanted to see this movie because of the location--I live in Raleigh, NC and the Outerbanks is truly one of the most beautiful places on this earth. However, the beauty of the location was overshadowed by the sheer awfulness of this movie. Predictable, schmatlzy, and just plain bad--I was p.o'ed that I wasted 1 hr 36 minutes of my life watching this crappy movie. I expected more from Lane and Geer, both seasoned actors. Admittedly, I'm not the demographic this movie targets, but come on, who could really believe this crap? Just say no and skip this one.","I mainly wanted to see this movie because of the location--I live in Raleigh, NC and the Outerbanks is truly one of the most beautiful places on this earth.

1,Set aside preconceptions if you can,"Most of us, myself included, have no frame of reference for legitimate sexual servitude. One of the true minority expressions of attraction, affection, and admiration, voluntary surrender of this degree is an almost ineffable experience. Like Anne Rice's Beauty series, The Story of O gives some insight into this world. In the age of feminism, the idea of such surrender is anathema, but following the story to the end we see that O is as much the master as is Stephen. In her perfect obedience, she enslaves the man who knows he will never find such perfect submission and is enchanted.The film is beautiful,as are the people. Taken as eye candy, it is worth the price, but is further and more complex.Recommended","Most of us, myself included, have no frame of reference for legitimate sexual servitude.

1,"beautiful, but not bach","From the opening chorus, you are immediately taken away by the beauty of this passion. The recitatives are superb and move brisquely. Overall, the music is very heartfelt and the intersperion of recitative, arias, chorales, and turbae choruses is splendid. However, don't expect Bach-like longer, contemplative arias- most arias are only about 2 minutes and many are not da capo. Nonetheless, almost every aria is sublime. Wonderful recording of an unjustly neglected work and composer","From the opening chorus, you are immediately taken away by the beauty of this passion. The recitatives are superb and move brisquely.

You are in no position whatsoever to place judgment on people you have never met just because they don't agree with your taste in music. Korn is a very talented band and if you don't like them, that's fine. That's the beauty of America. We are free to choose what we do and don't like. All I have to say to you is grow up and find better things to do then make fun of complete strangers.","I am writing this in response to a pathetic review written by dd Derangeddeath Chicago.

However, like Cinderella's beautiful carriage and gown disappeared, so to will it's beauty. By the second week the color of the leather had already started to fade. Thankfully, the rose gold facade hasn't worn of yet, probably because i stopped wearing it altogether. I still like the watch but i'll definitely have to spend about the same price i paid for it to get a good leather strap before i can wear it again","This is a very beautiful watch.

0,Ethereal Vision of 18th Century Life - Too Delicate For Me,"The charaters were thinly portrayed so it was hard to identify with them - clearly the author wanted the reader to be afloat and not grounded in detail. If you can connect poetically you can enjoy a book like this; if not, it is pretentious clap trap. I loved The Book Shop: A Novel by Fitzgerald, but this one was just too vague for my taste. For instance, Fritz's brother starts out jealous of Fritz's love idol, but then falls in love with her himself. There are no clues given as to how this transformation took place, no insights into what was so alluring about this giggling adolescent. Perhaps it's an upper class phenomenon where people who are bored with life create in their minds a world where some invented beauty obscures all else. I imagine the failure is within me, but if you have but one book to read by Fitzgerald, I'd recommend The Book Shop: A Novel.","The charaters were thinly portrayed so it was hard to identify with them - clearly the author wanted the reader to be afloat and not grounded in detail.

Rarely do I encounter a book that makes such an impression on me. I am filled with longing to read its pages once again. The writing style is wonderful and adds to the haunting beauty of its content. Not a typical four-course meal -- to compare it with food -- but more like a sushi dinner, or dimsum; skip around and eat whatever catches your eye!","After regretfully returning this book to the library more than ten years ago, and forgetting all about it in the course of life, I happened upon the title of this book while haunting the internet, and the beauty of this book all came rushing back to me.

At that point, the mouse was skipping and was not as responsive, so I invested in this little beauty.First off, if your a gamer, this is a must, its a pretty large mouse pad and shaped in a perfect crescent so that you can swing your wrists left and right quickly for the quick head shots. Also, it has 2 sides, one for office, and one for gaming. The black side is the gaming side, you will really notice how smooth it is on the surface, it works like a charm.If your into FPS gaming, this is a MUST.It also has these little rubber grips on the side which allow for stability so the mouse pad doesn't slide all over the place.","For the longest time I used my hard oak table as a mouse pad, it seemed to work O.K. until I got this higher DPI gaming mouse.

1,"How does that go? ""This book saved my life...""","This was the first raw food book I ever bought and it is a powerhouse of information, from nutrition to kitchen equipment to beauty tips, it got me on the right track from the first. I successfully transitioned to raw foods, lost 50 pounds, basically put my type 2 diabetes in remission, I sleep better, have so much more energy, think more clearly and so much more. Of course, when one is looking at a cookbook, one wants to know about the recipes. They are delicious. This is still one of my favorite go to books for the basics and the elegant, alike. I give this a 5 stars, thumbs up, you won't be sorry, recommendation.","This was the first raw food book I ever bought and it is a powerhouse of information, from nutrition to kitchen equipment to beauty tips, it got me on the right track from the first.

1,Perfect Fit,"I have a Tempstar furnace unit and purchased this replacement vent blower. This blower bolted up exactly like the original one with no issues. The unit that came was slightly different cosmetically, but posed no fitment issues.My previous blower was starting to make a scraping noise, which was the fan blades being slightly bent and hitting the fan shroud. Technician said that it would probably last for quite some time, but to inform me that it is something I could easily replace.....he was right! Simple!Item came with 2 felt rings. The felt ring goes behind the vent blower (when looking at it installed) around the fan blade opening. So, install the felt ring before you completely bolt up the new unit.My furnace is much quiter and may possibly run a little better?A+","I have a Tempstar furnace unit and purchased this replacement vent blower.

1,Quite unlike anything else,"Ambient. Ethereal. Surreal. Moody. Emotional. Visceral. This CD is incredible. I have been impatiently waiting since I heard a rough cut of ""Heaven Sent"" six months ago. It was worth the wait - but I'm glad I didn't have to wait any longer. The music on this CD is to be experienced for long unbroken periods of time where complete absorption is possible. The songs take their time getting where they're going and the raw power in Andy Prickett's guitar is almost unbearable at times. I'm not talking about searing faster-than-light rockstar solos; I'm talking about pure emotion that packs a wallop. There's no way you will be able to fully appreciate the beauty of the music the first time through. I imagine it will be in my CD player for a LONG time before being replaced. Please, if you consider yourself to be fan of music, give this CD a try. You won't be sorry.","Ambient. Ethereal. Surreal. Moody. Emotional. Visceral. This CD is incredible.

This DVD presents the movie in a more sharper and clearer picture than before...it was produced in 1978. I must have been about 8 or 9 when I saw it and never understood the beauty of it. Being a little girl, I always preferred Judy Garland's verion of The Wizard of Oz. Now that I'm a 31 year-old adult, I can really appreciate the urban version of The Wizard of Oz. With Diana Ross as Dorothy, Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, and Nipsey Russel as the Tinman, this movie should have won an Oscar. I highly recommend it.","Now that I've grown up, I can appreciate this movie for the phenomenon that it was!

Price is so exciting in her arias. Batiastini has a gorgeous voice and sings just beautifully. And it is such a pleasure to hear Corelli sing live. And Karajan, obviously a brilliant conductor, but always with a beauty mirror close by, seems in this performance to be really excitingly with the singers and they with him. There is also a live recording of him with Callas that is incredible as well. Anyway, if you're inclined, you are in for a beautiful, exciting evening of opera with this CD. So happy to have come across it years ago and happy it is still available for others to discover.","No way around it.

Do you think John Wayne, Bogart, or Paul Newman would use anti-wrinkle cream on their faces?I don't think so!Save your money and buy this month's Maxim and a six pack. Believe me women don't want girlie men who have their nails done."
1,Very Chic!,"I got this bag at my baby shower and I loved it! Not only is it roomy enough to fit all of baby's things, but I am able to fit my cell phone and wallet as well as a cosmetic bag. It's stylish and looks more like a purse than a diaper bag! It also has a plastic bag attached to put soiled clothes and comes with a small changing mat.Overall, I see myself using this bag for years to come. It is great for the price!","I got this bag at my baby shower and I loved it!

1,Unsettlingly Beautiful,"Wow. I did enjoy this book, but it was QUITE unsettling... disturbing, even. I just didn't see the end coming at all. While not an uplifting book, it does have moments of beauty. The shock of the end really overshadowed the majority of the book. The haunting quality of it is really lingering... and I have no idea of what I will read next. I did really like it, even if it was so shockingly upsetting.","Wow.

1,good until the last five minutes,"This is a stunningly beautiful movie. The director has a wonderful I for seeing the beauty of nature and capturing the innocence of his star, Zhang Ziyi, however without giving too much away the last five minutes was extremely frustrating. Those who have seen the movie I am sure know what I mean, but if you are down stay down. I did not realize snow had resurrecting powers.There will of course be comparisons to ""Hero"" and while for most of the movie it compares well, in the end it just falls short. If I had to keep one or the other, the answer would be ""Hero"".","This is a stunningly beautiful movie.

0,AVOID THIS MOVIE! SERIOUSLY!,"This movie is horrible. I suspect a lot of the positive reviews come from people who either are involved with the film or close to those folks -- or possibly from people paid to write positive reviews. Or perhaps, they were on drugs while they watched it.I have no problem with less structured films. That's the beauty of independent stuff. But this film had a very thin plot and terrible actors. It paid no attention to character development -- at all. The best acting came from a very young girl - and I'm sure I'm being generous to her because of her age and cuteness.The cinematography is horrendous. It looks like it was filmed with a webcam. The director looks like he tossed in elements just to make the film underground. You know - things like chill out lounge music, ambiguous plots, mysterious characters. Unfortunately, these things cannot hide an empty plot.AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!","This movie is horrible.

1,Brilliant Collection!!!,"Those who'll get their hands on these rarities won't regret. For such a band(DJ?) to come up with an album like their last one was a surprise, not to say disappointment. They really had to come up with something better, and quick. This is just the perfect mix. Coming from EXPERIENCE, their first ""original"", towards the last album, combining singles with rarities and remixes of such musical beauty and talent, was a great step towards redemption. Prodigy has always been my favorite electrorock band, and this release comes to bring a bit of peace after the last disastrous project.

1,Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End,"Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End (Widescreen Edition)While the movie is quite long and the plot quite convoluted with twists and turns, this is an entertaining movie. There are elements that I don't think are good for children to watch, ie, some of the characters' special makeup and effects are quite scary. Also, Johnny Depp's character was just too strange in some scenes.","Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End Widescreen EditionWhile the movie is quite long and the plot quite convoluted with twists and turns, this is an entertaining movie.

0,It's difficult to believe the ratings on this CD,"If this CD is ""smooth"" and full of ""grace and beauty"", then I have to assume that I wasn't listening to the same Joshua Redman CD that the other reviewers were listening to....I have a large jazz collection and for some reason I hadn't listened much to Mr. Redman. Now I know why.....Many of the cuts on this CD are quite the opposite of ""smooth"", and in fact are harsh and cold ! In fact this is one of the few CD's I've bought in the last ten years that I would like to return.....My inclination after listening to the entire CD several times is that Joshua Redman is vastly over-rated...there are so many great jazz musicians who are more talented than he is, but then maybe he and his fans make up for it by being pretentious...","If this CD is smooth and full of grace and beauty, then I have to assume that I wasn't listening to the same Joshua Redman CD that the other reviewers were listening to....I have a large jazz collection and for some reason I hadn't listened much to Mr. Redman.

1,thank you,"After I finished ""la Maravilla"", I was sure it would be a long time before I read a book that moved me, entertained me, and improved me as much. But within a few months I came across a copy of ""Silver Cloud Cafe"" , which turned out to be, in some ways, an even better book. I am in awe of the talent of Alfredo Vea, and I am deeply thankfull for the books he has written. The humanity of his characters, and the beauty of his language make him, in my opinion, the best writer of our time.","After I finished la Maravilla, I was sure it would be a long time before I read a book that moved me, entertained me, and improved me as much.

1,"Dated, maybe, but excellent resource with great ideas!","This book has a special place in my heart because it is the only wedding etiquette book of its era I have ever seen with ideas for planning a special and beautiful but informal ceremony/reception. So many etiquette mavens seem to think there is no room for creativity and dignity and beauty if a wedding does not involve dresses with trains trailing out the church door or dad's pockets, bank accounts and credit limits ending up empty, empty, EMPTY. Ms. Wood does use the old-fashioned-seeming categories of formal, semi-formal and informal, but within each one she offers ideas and suggestions to make any couple's day beautiful, and that's the important thing, right?","This book has a special place in my heart because it is the only wedding etiquette book of its era I have ever seen with ideas for planning a special and beautiful but informal ceremonyreception.

1,Power cord adds voltage zip to electic razor,"Finally, power in an electric shaver. Plugging into the 110-120 mains may seem out-of-date, but this direct, full-power makes a difference. The rotary blades cut crisply and swiftly ... never pausing even on the toughfest beard. You can hear the blades sawing the hairs as if they were inside a lawnmower. I'm amazed that this relatively low price device can give a shave comparable to 4-blade wet razors. I still have a battery Braun for travel, but day-to-day this has been a well worth the price.Takes about 2 weeks for beard and skin to adjust to the cutting closeness.(I recommend also using Remington ""FaceSaver"" pre-shave powder stick. This handy inexpensive cosmetic facilitates glide and skin smoothness. Found it at Walmart. Comes in a plastic stick container. Push case bottom to apply a thin layer grease-less talc which helps whirring blades glide over skin.)","Finally, power in an electric shaver.

0,More money than what its worth,"This version of Down was recorded at the House of Blues in Las Vegas just before the release of No. 4. It is not bad, however you can purchase the track on the Down EP. This entire CD spells out hard hits, from Down to Atlanta! Down is a banging heavy guitar track. Heaven and Hot Rods is vintage STP, with a solid drum / guitar combination with singer Scott's beauty of his voice. Sour Girl is a standout song on this CD, it is a very soft song built around the lyrics and it tells a story of love and leaving. Church on Tuesday is a solid track focusing around Scott's vocals and lyrics accompanied with a big guitar. No Way Out is always a fun song, it's a song you sing when you have someone that you do not like and they have trapped themselves. Sex and Violence is another fast paced alternative rock marvel, with brief pauses between guitar riffs to catch your breath.","This version of Down was recorded at the House of Blues in Las Vegas just before the release of No. 4.

0,I can't believe I paid $50 for this,"Yet another reminder not to listen to hype and to check Amazon reviews before buying. DRM aside, this is just not that great a game. It's a collection of 5 been-there-done-that mini games that individually would go for maybe $5 in the bargain bin, if that. EA already gave one of them away for free. 3D graphics are cool, online content sharing is cool, but neither are new. Cosmetics aside, there's just not much complexity in game strategy - there aren't that many different things to do, so once you've played it once, there doesn't seem to be much point in playing again. I could live with that for a $20 game, but this thing is seriously overpriced. There's no way I'm paying even more for expansion packs.

The cohabitating Letters mostly keep to themselves, playing at ""making words,"" which is incomprehensible to the Radish and the Shoe. The watercolors are whimsical and charming.Then a pair of Scissors attacks the Book! Much mayhem, much destruction.

The plot being time travel/dimension travel. Oh one more thing that is common is that the characters seem kind of stupid. They will do things that they shouldn't and then they die because of what they did.The book started out well, with reasonable suspense.

Very oily so if you have breakouts this would not be for you. Didn't notice any difference at all and used for about a month. Very greasy so hard to use under makeup.,I've tried almost everything that comes along and wasted a lot of money in the process. Thought this might be different but wasn't. EXPENSIVE.

1,A beautiful book with slight flaws,"This is a gorgeous book of southwest photographs. It has many examples of how to take great photographs. An interesting feature is the photographers comments about each photograph, found in the back of the book. There are only a few flaws in my humble view. Some of the photographs were printed with very exagerated color saturation. This is painful in some cases. Another problem is Mr. Muench's use of a split density magenta filter for several of the photographs. He tries to give the scenes a warm glow but the magenta color looks totally fake, especially when one sees it only across the top of the photograph. Please throw that split density magenta filter away and let the southwest present its beauty naturally. Still a great and valuable book to own.","This is a gorgeous book of southwest photographs.

1,"A Litany of Loss, Love, and Hope","This book made hash of every stereotyped soldier-poet I have ever encountered in literature (sadly, I have encountered none in Life), and fools of everyone who ever believed in them. If the protagonist/narrator is based upon an actual person (as I suspect is the case, since the work reads more like a journal than a novel per se), then I envy him his experiences, however painful, for they have lent him a capacity to apprehend and percieve the beauty of this world and articulate it in a manner unlike anyone I have ever read who has set pen to paper. To say that I cried, that I felt sadness, that I was moved beyond words by the power of this account of horror, heroism, loyalty, friendship, and love, falls far short of the truth - and the truth is that The Spirit Horses is by far one of the most haunting, beautiful books in print. I applaud Mr. Kindrick's efforts, and look forward to seeing more of his work in years to come.","This book made hash of every stereotyped soldier-poet I have ever encountered in literature sadly, I have encountered none in Life, and fools of everyone who ever believed in them.

1,Love It,"I got the American Girl subscription when I was nine, and now I'm thirteen and still love it. It has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the ""lunch box"" section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. If your looking for magazines about style, boys and makeup, this magazine may not be for you, but you can still enjoy makeup and boys while liking crafts and monkey themed sleepovers as well. It is a short magazine, but they make up for it by having the JUMBO summer issue. I think its definitaly worth the money.","I got the American Girl subscription when I was nine, and now I'm thirteen and still love it.

0,Masterpiece of trash...,"(...) With Burzum, I don't have too much to say. Varg Vikernes obvioulsy has some level of musical talent. I don't dispute that, musically, this album is up there with the other Norwegian Black Metal bands (I STILL think Emperor were the best musicians), full of aggression and mixing it with odd passages of beauty inspired by Norwegian folk and history. What ruins it is Vikernes' voice. Whereas Ihsahn shifts from operatic to evil screaming, and Attila Csihar sounds like he's gargling glass, (both of which are perfect for black metal) Varg's screaming vocals sound like a dying dog barking desperately to get attention before it expires. It's not singing, it's not even screaming, it's just a bunch of violent barks closer to death metal than black metal. Hate the man, not the music...a good statement, except that the man destroys the music, and thus turns what is a good black metal album into trash (in my ears anyway). (...)","...

She is so obnoxious that I found myself rooting for Charlene Cummins, the woman stealing Vera's pathetic identity, and enjoying every new assault on Vera's privacy. Charlene pretty much imbodied all the qualities that Vera found so easy to deride. Sadly, the identity that Charlene envisioned for Vera was as much beyond Vera's narrow-minded capabilities as it was her own.

0,Hollow Sound,"I can understand people enjoying this album, but in light of what Yes had presented in the past it is quite bad. Though most of the 70's line-up remained on this album, they all seemed to replace their dynamic skills with run-of-the-mill pop licks. For instance, Alan White's sounds almost like a drum machine here, whereas previous albums proved him to be very creative and interesting. Once again, I can see what people find to like here- it really is produced well and is very tight- but sadly it is devoid of any of the magic of Tales, the kinetic energy and inovation of Relayer or the beauty and awsome power of Close to the Edge.","I can understand people enjoying this album, but in light of what Yes had presented in the past it is quite bad.

0,The Dark Knight Didn't Rise,"I found this third part in the modern ""Dark Knight"" movie series really disappointing and much too predictable.

I enjoyed the first two in the ""Dark Knight"" series far, far better in terms of their story lines and action than this third installment. Anne Hathaway is a wonderful ""eye candy"" but her role (not acting) is weak.

1,Great Watch,"I have been wearing the same watch since 1994, and only recently had to replace it due to cosmetic reasons. The watch has had the batteries replaced, new bands, etc But the functions have never failed. I own two of these watches now, and have just recently ordered a G Shock. Casio has a life long customer with me. The watch itself is large, and looks good if you have the build for it. I'm 6'2 220, and it still stands out on my wrist.","I have been wearing the same watch since 1994, and only recently had to replace it due to cosmetic reasons.

1,Excellent,"Even better than advertised. Very sturdy and relatively easy to install. A small wrench is included; no additional tools are required. The instructions say that you also need a screwdriver, but you don't. The included wrench is all you need...plus a little dexterity.We purchased it for a family member who is recovering from surgery and temporarily needs a safety bar. Our bath/shower configuration is not conducive to safety bars that permanently affix to the wall, and we didn't feel suction cup attachments would be safe enough. This multi-grip bar is perfect for our family member's needs.When our family member recovers, we'll be able to easily remove the grab bar and store it until it is needed again some day.Other Pros:1) The grab bar is nice cosmetically. It is not cheap-looking at all.2) Easy to clean.3) Because it is removable and fairly light-weight, you can take it with you when travelling or if you move.We are very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.","Even better than advertised.

0,"Makes Dylan Look Like A Buffoon, Blanchett as Dylan is Awkward","The movie captures so little if any of the beauty of Bob Dylan. It makes him look like a flake and a buffoon. I imagine it is hard to portray such a complex character, but this movie seems to do such a poor job of it. Blanchett as Dylan is awkward in every scene that she plays him. It transcends androgyny and makes Dylan look overly feminine and freakish. It was hard to get lost in the movie during these scenes. I was not there and only have his music and video as a reference for what I think Dylan was like, but the movie reeks of hollywood's touch and feels like a characture that catches much more of the bad and bizarre than the genius of Dylan.","The movie captures so little if any of the beauty of Bob Dylan.

It has some kind of consistency that ""temporarily"" gives the impresion that is working, but soon I found out that it was an illusion. It seems to cover some mild wrinkles but the effect is gone in probably two hours (I can obtain this result with good makeup). Oh well, good luck to all of you, I am sure that there must be something out there I just have to keep trying!","I am 29 years of age and I truly was hoping that this product will work at leat ok based on other reviews.

1,Fantastic Movie!,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer Jones!!!! So, I love any movie she is in... But, truly, she is great in this movie. A very diverse actress, with an unusual beauty for that time... she plays the part of ""a girl from the wrong side of the tracks"" like no-one else can. Charlton Heston looks BEAUTIFUL as ever, the character he plays is pitch perfect! And the time, place, and era of the film are spot on! Karl Malden is great as well, playing the ""Southern Gentleman"" and father figure to a T.This movie is as intriguing as ""Duel in The Sun,"" in which Jennifer is paired with Gregory Peck.I LOVE THIS MOVIE............","First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer Jones!!!!

0,Not worth the gamble,I was hoping that since I was actually buying from Amazon and not a secondary seller that my bottle of Bright Crystal would not be a knock off. I was wrong! I have my one bottle of bright crystal purchased at a cosmetic store to compare directly with my amazon version that I received today. The amazon bottle is overpowering with the smell of alcohol. NOT at all like the true fragrance.

0,Copycats sometimes prosper,"I first read this book many years ago, when it was first published. Let me say that no one has any business reviewing this book unless they have first read The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, which was written before the Sword of Shannara. The plots are virtually identical. Since then, Mr. Brooks has written many original stories which are excellent and which are not copies of anyone else as far as I know. Even the Sword of Shannara is a good story, but it is quite clearly to me, mostly a copy of Tolkien with a few cosmetic changes, i.e., different character names and different talisman characteristics. Shame on Terry for doing this, but at least it led to the Elfstones of Shannara, which is a superb and original work.","I first read this book many years ago, when it was first published.

1,The history of Mardi Gras through 3 generations,"The story of Mardi Gras in New Orleans is recounted in this novel about 3 generations of young men and women whose lives run in parallel. ""L'Americaine"" Andy Breckenridge falls in love with the creole beauty Estelle Lenoir during the season of her debut in 1890's New Orleans.

The circle continues up through the 1940's as the descendants of Estelle and Andy find their lives remain intertwined until both sides find happiness and fulfilment.

I am in awe of his beautiful, uncompromising talents and his willingnes to share it with all, still after all these years of being passed over in the industry. How amazing to be this talented and adored by many and still not given the msuical respect his beauty commands. Every cut on this album is completely soulstirring, and makes you take a look at yourself and life. He's made it tough for ordinary men to come romanitc, because his poetry ssems to have been told to him directly from above! Ahhhh, pure beauty this is, looking forward to the next..........buy it now--but beware---you may never look at your other music the same. Peace and Love.","I've been listening to TTD since he's graced us with his first gift of The Hardline...

0,"""Dude Looks Like A Lady!""","Just a sorry excuse for an Aerosmith cover band with even your clone version of Steven Tyler only younger and with less talent. Glittery clothes; more makeup than Madonna; 10,000 dollar hair extensions; and close to zero talent sums up what this band is all about. Steven Tyler must have had this band in mind when he wrote 'Dude Looks Like a Lady.' What made Hollywood think this band was going to last. Even more disturbing, why do people think this is good glam rock? It's not even original! Along with Poison, this has to be the sorriest glam band to come out of the eighties. Just listen to Aerosmith instead of this crap. If good '80s glam is what you really want, just listen to early Motley Crue, Ratt, Dokken, or even Bon Jovi instead of this joke of a band.","Just a sorry excuse for an Aerosmith cover band with even your clone version of Steven Tyler only younger and with less talent.

1,Will this satisfy your folk-rock craving? YOU BET!!,"Roman Candle is a great example of ""Elliott Unplugged."" If you're looking for some relaxing but powerful ballads and painful tuneful traumas this is where you need to turn. However, an unseasoned fan may not like this album at first due to the roughness of the recordings themselves. On the second or third listen, though, the wrinkles smooth themselves out and the true beauty of Roman Candle shows itself. My second favorite of Smith's solo efforts next to Either/Or.","Roman Candle is a great example of Elliott Unplugged.

1,Another great psyco-drama,"Once again, Chuck Palahniuk has come forth with a book that alerts us of the social crisis that is all around us. We are fed visions of fame and beauty and hypnotised into wanting that for ourselves. Invisible Monsters tells us that we need not torture ourselves to achieve these things. All we need to do is let go of the dream. These people we see on tv and in magazines are not what real people are like. And, chances are, their no happier than we are. Mr. Palahniuk reminds us again that we are all a part of the same compost heap.","Once again, Chuck Palahniuk has come forth with a book that alerts us of the social crisis that is all around us.

1,"For Palahniuk fans, but not others","This is go-ahead Palahniuk. Whereas Fight Club and Survivor struggle to introduce us to Chuck's ""Baudrillardian"" take on modern American life (cuckolding Delillo in the process), Invisible Monsters assumes one knows where Chuck's coming from, leaving him to focus on the characters. And Palahniuk's characters are always self-aware, but in IM they transcend that awareness by focusing on the beauty of ugliness and the ugliness of beauty-- thus, they become ""monsters"" who are ""invisble"" to themselves. But, like other works focusing on self-reference, ultimatly the book offers nothing-- it closes the loop on itself, and the reader can only gaze, as at an odd-shaped cloud formation. Beautiful, unique, but just another cloud, and no better than any other, more plain cloud, at explaining how the weather works.Read this if you like Palahniuk. Read this if you don't. But of your ambivalent, read something else first.","This is go-ahead Palahniuk.

1,One of the BEST BOOKS of 2001 !!!,"An exquisite collection of new black & white photographs from renown British photographer John Healy, this is stirring testimony to both the beauty of the black male nude as well as the incredible power of fine art portraiture. Healy has crafted such potent imagery here that one feels completely lifted from the premise that they are viewing a book and instead feel transported to another stratosphere where light and form and mood command total attention of one's consciousness. The technical refinement of each image is obvious but what really sets this work apart is the masterful way that Healy poses his subjects. They grace each page totally and utterly possessing it.","An exquisite collection of new black  white photographs from renown British photographer John Healy, this is stirring testimony to both the beauty of the black male nude as well as the incredible power of fine art portraiture.

0,How can something so beautiful be so unsatisfying?,"They say beauty is only skin deep. Can that adage apply to literature as well as people? The Little Friend would seem to prove that it can. Donna Tartt has outdone herself producing chapter upon chapter of exquisite, tasteful, occasionally insightful prose. But to what end? After so much bounty, one feels empty and at a loss as to why. Perhaps that was Tartt's literary intent (though I would tend to doubt it). Perhaps she simply got lost in the rapture of creation. Either way, The Little Friend is a stunning disappointment. It's all style with a paucity of substance. Perhaps she thought no one would notice. That remains the true mystery of The Little Friend. And Tartt's motivation is the enigma.","They say beauty is only skin deep. Can that adage apply to literature as well as people? The Little Friend would seem to prove that it can.

0,Minuteness left beauty entirely behind,"I don't remember when last I read any prose that comprises of mainly adjectives! I was constantly groping for my red pen to edit out the superfluous ones. Of course, descriptions are necessary but the overabundance here completely defeats the purpose. I can't describe what I mean better than to quote Jane Austen: ""Every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind."" So also Durrell. The excess of words and descriptive expressions, intended no doubt to paint vivid images in our minds, hamper the reader instead of creating a stage for the drama about to unfold. We are lost among the brushes, pigments and paint tubes, never getting far away enough to see the whole painting. I usually 'disappear' into literature but when reading this man's words I can't for a moment forget that I'm reading.","I don't remember when last I read any prose that comprises of mainly adjectives!

Bush.In an interview featurette on the disc, Barr says 9/11 was the impetus for getting off her butt and performing her new material.

1,Highly recommended.,"Rock Collection is Pond's masterpiece (so far). It's not as fun and energetic as their first album, but for the first time (as a whole) the songs have real meaning. I was very surprised to see how far Pond has come lyrically especially in songs like Twins, Spokes, and Scoliosis. This album seems to have a theme. I think it's about dealing with rejection, finding inner-beauty, and also remembering the past, and learning from mistakes. I look forward to the next Pond release with great anticipation.","Rock Collection is Pond's masterpiece so far.

This just might be the worst horror film or any film I've ever seen. The story was written by a child, the so called actors couldn't get a job doing dinner theater, the special FX were weak and low budget to say the least and the direction was non-existant!!! The only redeeming qualities of the movie, and this is by a long stretch, are the shooting locations and scenery. It was set in Ireland but was shot in Connecticut and the locations are the only saving grace in this film. At least the DP shot great scenery and captured the beauty of Ireland.I would rate this film a 1/2 star on a 5 star scale.

1,An excellent summary of the Canon,"Margaret Chute's Stories of Shakespeare uses an novel technique. She writes treatments for 36 of the plays (those in the First Folio), a present tense chronology of the plot in simple, eloquent language. This book is useful for actors, students or the casual fan. The book also appreciates the beauty of Shakespeare's language by offering selected excerpts. Further, it recognises the humor, the history and the tragedy of the story and gives concise summaries so the reader can always follow the action. This is an excellent book.","Margaret Chute's Stories of Shakespeare uses an novel technique.

1,The All-Time Best Movie Ever,"An American Werewolf In London has everything-Action, romance, suspense, gore, and a kicking soundtrack. Even though it was made 30 years ago, it holds the test of time amazingly well. Rick Baker's makeup alone will hold you spellbound but the story is nothing to sneeze at either. Follow an unfortunate American pair of friends as they meet up with their worst nightmare on vacation in England and by the end of it, you will find yourself pitying the great terrifying beast that is wreaking havoc on the town of London. In my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made and much more riveting than your usual horror movie.","An American Werewolf In London has everything-Action, romance, suspense, gore, and a kicking soundtrack.

Interracial dating is an anomaly! Most couples want their offspring to look like them.I admit I find men of all races of attractive not just white men or in the case of black men they can appreciate the beauty of women of all races doesn't mean they're gonna tie the knot outside their ethnic background.,I hate interracial romance movies they are all the same.

I had been playing guitars for 25 years, when I saw the Agile 2000 in the net, I was a kind of sceptical but after I received it and started using it, I'm playing on every night since I got it!!!. Sound, finishing and beauty of the guitar are very nice. Also the price is going up so it is a good investment as well. I got it 6 months ago and I'm thinking to buy other versions of Agile near future.","I had been surprised for the quality of this guitar.

0,"You're joking, right?","Can you say anthropomorphization? I would have loved to hear a director's commentary on the DVD that went something like this: ""When they first approached me about directing this film, I thought 'What the heck do I know about bears? Okay, I'll do it!'"" This is the silliest, most insulting movie I've seen in a long time, and I watch a lot of movies. The only redeeming factors in this film were the scenery and the inherent beauty of the wildlife.","Can you say anthropomorphization?

0,"King runs out of ideas, but not the desire to just finish it","I was stunned by the sadism of King's ending. I don't know how else to say it, or sugar coat it. It is mean and hateful, both in the anger directed toward the reader in his casual dismissal of his Constant Readers' desire to actually read the ending and the cruelty he unleashes on his main character. If he wanted to end the series with a ""doozy"", he succeeded. But it lacks beauty, lyricism or poetry. Though it does have irony. Yes, in abundance. Someone once said ""irony is hypocrisy with flair"" and somehow that seems to fit King's approach here. I agree with someone else who said that King seems to have grown to hate his characters and resent his obligation to finish the story. He seems to have just wanted to get the albatross off of his neck and get on with what's left of his life. If he writes any more books connected to the Dark Tower universe, I won't be reading it.","I was stunned by the sadism of King's ending. I don't know how else to say it, or sugar coat it.

1,"Nice, inexpensive Vanity","My 2 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. The assembly was very easy. The vanity and seat are sturdy though I do put it against the wall because it can be knocked over if bumped hard enough. The mirror is plastic but it doesn't seem to bother her. The accessories are sturdy and well put together. They don't seem like they will break easily.I also got her the extra accessory kit that had the dryer, curling iron and fake makeup in it. She loves the dryer. It makes a quiet noise but no air.She loves to brush her hair and teeth in front of her vanity.","My 2 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it.

1,Disgrace,"I, and everyone I know who has read this book, has been deeply disturbed by it. Ones specific reaction depends on ones sex and knowledge of South Africa. The characters lives are painted as an unrelenting misery that can only become worse. Any beauty in the locations is ignored. Coetzee piles on the agony by the shovel full and after the third read I began to wonder if this was not a deliberate exercise to win a Booker. Read it, but not if you're prone to depression.","I, and everyone I know who has read this book, has been deeply disturbed by it.

1,Skin Eternal with favorite antioxidants,"Very generous amount of cream. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can tell there is a difference in the depth of my wrinkles. It is a little heavier than I would like but after a while it seems to absorb and I apply makeup, a light powder and it tones down the shine. It doesn't feel greasy after a while. I wish it had some sunscreen in it so I prefer to use it at night. I use it also on my crepey arms and there is marked improvement there. I'll order this again.","Very generous amount of cream.

1,"5 Stars +, Extraordinary and Powerful","Hochschild has written a gentle and elegant portrait of his family. I chose this book by pure luck (and Hochschild's King Leopold's Ghost). I have been rewarded handsomely. It is one of my absolute favorite memoirs that I have ever read. It disturbed me, it moved me and set me on the way to examining and recalling my own memories, especially of the beauty of lost summers of yesteryear. Yet the book is able to deal with the complexities of extraordinarily difficult relationships, class and race consciousness and the very nature of power in society in a though provoking and beautiful way. Most importantly, Hochschild teaches that the past and all whom we know and love will live on within us.","Hochschild has written a gentle and elegant portrait of his family.

0,"Health benefits are those of grapes, not black currants","If you're looking, as I was, for the type of black currants that researchers have found are higher in antioxidants than grapes and may have powerful health benefits, look elsewhere. It's not so much that the manufacturer is being dishonest as that ""black currant"" has come to mean ""Zante currant"" in the U.S. What researchers studied was the Ribes nigrum species; the common name ""black currant"" here is just going to mislead you into buying small raisins. Ribes nigrum is a berry that grows on bushes, while grapes are unrelated and grow on vines.After buying these and finding they tasted a lot like raisins (I should have read the earlier reviews), I did some research in Wikipedia and on the web and finally found a source of real black currants, which I've just ordered. Amazon has some products that list Ribes nigrum as an ingredient, but doesn't seem to carry the berries, just seed oil, cosmetics, and powders.","If you're looking, as I was, for the type of black currants that researchers have found are higher in antioxidants than grapes and may have powerful health benefits, look elsewhere.

1,Disney at it's best....,"Ok, I know this wasn't one of the grand scale, high dollar sound tracks like The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast, but this is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and sound tracks. As a kindergarten teacher it is really fun with the kids. I love Sebastian Cabot and Phil Harris is at his best. You will want to dance with King Louie, and appreciate the bare necessities of life with Moglie and Baloo. It is a must have for any Disney fan and collection.","Ok, I know this wasn't one of the grand scale, high dollar sound tracks like The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast, but this is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and sound tracks.

0,Awful,"Poorly written, clumsily plotted, and pretty tedious. The characters are flat and stereotypical and the dialogue silly and overwrought. This is a slow-moving marathon trek through classic examples of bad writing. Attempts to be derivitive of better thrillers are obvious and fail. Set in the Northwest, it manages to suggest none of its beauty or atmosphere. A big disappointment for the price and a waste of time.","Poorly written, clumsily plotted, and pretty tedious.

0,Ultimate ripoff,"Don't be fooled by the title, or the fact that this is a two-disk set; anyone who just wants to watch Pamela Anderson do what she does best will be sorely disappointed.The first disk consists of nothing more than interviews with various people, such as Mr. Hefner, talking about Pam's career. I had to ask myself whether they really think anybody cares about any of this. My conclusion, of course, is that they don't; Playboy merely padded this to two disks with a load of tripe.Even worse, the second disk is only a compilation of previously released material, most of it shortened considerably (many are shorter than a minute!) from its original length.I would strongly advise fans of Pamela Anderson to look elsewhere to get their fill of gazing longingly at her beauty.","Don't be fooled by the title, or the fact that this is a two-disk set anyone who just wants to watch Pamela Anderson do what she does best will be sorely disappointed.The first disk consists of nothing more than interviews with various people, such as Mr. Hefner, talking about Pam's career.

1,Great Joshua Tree video!,Michael Reardon's new Joshua Tree video shows the park's radically diverse climbing scene completely and with a strong cast of female and male climbers. The camera work is strong and it catches both Joshua Tree's unusual beauty and the giant variety of climbing you can do there. There are also some pretty spectacular and scary moments.

1,A Genuine Joy to Read,"What attracted me to this book when I opened it in a local bookstore was a chapter with the title 'Pig Snouts and Sequins.' With that provacative title, I just had to read on. That chapter looks at Proverbs 11:22, a verse about a 'beautiful woman without discretion.' Well, every woman (and man) I know has met that type of woman, and the author of this book shows a real understanding of her type, and of the verse from Proverbs. I was hooked enough to buy this book, which has truly deepened my appreciation for the insights of Proverbs. Each short chapter looks at one particular verse from Proverbs, and gives some insight into everyday matters--gossip, honesty, temper, beauty-without-discretion, materialism, and the list goes on. I like all the books in this '101' series, but this is my favorite, since I think it is really the most practical book about the Bible I've read in a long long time.","What attracted me to this book when I opened it in a local bookstore was a chapter with the title 'Pig Snouts and Sequins.'

It was much too long, tedious, detailed, and seemed to drage aimlessly in no direction to end the story. Between most of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tales I've read and heard, this is just another one of them in the heap. Beauty stood out, but Rose Daughter just... sits. If you want to read a fairytale taken story, you may want to read Zel (rupunzel) by Donna Jo Napoli and Ella Enchanted (cinderella) by Gail Levine more than Robin Mckinley's latest novel. They are beautifully written and there IS a point in the story.","I enjoyed reading Mckinley's first Beauty and the Beast novel Beauty more than this one.

1,A mix of abrasive emotions and compassionate insight.,"The Indian Runner is insightful, intelligent, and powerfully creative. It takes human emotion to a level unlike any other, and leaves you breathless with a dry mouth. Creating a sophisticated harmony of pain and devotion to family- depicting the relationships that occur in a small town, expressing the importance of brotherhood, love, loss-and realizing the powers of commitment and regret, once again Sean Penn has conquered the greatness which strives in his aestheticism. He is one of the only true talents in Hollywood today. While most of Tinseltown is producing such drivel as Twister with its superficial characters, deprived script and shallow approach to passing itself off as a ""film"", The Indian Runner offers us a unique beauty of real small towns, and the pain people create and feel within the boundrys of their own doubts and fears.","The Indian Runner is insightful, intelligent, and powerfully creative.

1,Short and sweet review,"I will totally admit that this movie is not going to win video of the year or anything, but damn - its a FUN zombie movie. You have key characters that turn into zombies - and I think the zombie makeup is actually quite creepy. (I love the nun at the end who gets it!)You can pretty much imagine the plot and the plot twists - since it does not take a rocket scientist to figure this movie out, but if you are looking for a good entertaining zombie romp (yes, I said 'romp') then this might be your kind of movie!","I will totally admit that this movie is not going to win video of the year or anything, but damn - its a FUN zombie movie.

1,Kay's is a master at describing love.,"I am stuck with Kay's facility to move reader's with his descriptions of love. Not eros, although he does that well, and perhaps too often for my tastes, but the profound feelings shared by lovers and soulmates committed to a common purpose. Moreover, Kay's prose occasionally reaches a level where, as the reader, I have had to pause, put the book down, and savor both the beauty of the language he has employed, and the insight I have gained into life, love and faith. Sailing to Sarantium, although not as consuming as Tigana, continues this great tradition and is an excellent read.","I am stuck with Kay's facility to move reader's with his descriptions of love.

1,Strong heroine and role model,"This is a lovely and compelling story. More than just a coming-of-age tale, it is a tale of survival. Our young heroine has endured considerable tragedy in ""modern"" life; her time on the vast and unforgiving tundra will test her in ways many adults could not manage. She shows intelligence, drive, persistence, patience, empathy and spirituality. She is truly torn and her final decision on whether to stay on the tundra as Miyax or return to a village as Julie is a heart-wrenchingly difficult one.George paints a desolate landscape that still has beauty and majesty. Julie's character unfolds as her confidence in her skills grows. We feel her excitement and despair. Relish her successes and worry over her missteps. The book is aimed at children ages 10 and older, but adults will enjoy it as well.Christina Moore does a wonderful job performing the audio, bringing not only Julie but the animals and landscape of Alaska to life.","This is a lovely and compelling story.

0,Disney blew it !!,"Unlike previous Disney Classics this movie is much like the hunchback and other recent Disney flops. Disney needs to wake up and go back to the innocent days of Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations, Mary Poppins, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Etc... Bring back the Classic songs and stay away from the liberal agenda that has nothing to do with Walt Disney and would surely make him angry at what is being done to his company and name.","Unlike previous Disney Classics this movie is much like the hunchback and other recent Disney flops.

0,"Terrible product, dangerously weak!","When this product first came, and after assembly, it had considerable cosmetic damage to the metal back of the seat, in addition to deep scratches. The product definitely looked ""used"" even though it came disassembled in its box. After numerous emails with the company and asking for proof and photos of the damage (as if I needed the extra burden now of providing proof for their own faulty product), they offered to refund. I decided to keep it anyway as I am more interested in functionality than aesthetics. A few months later, a friend sat on one of them and it broke down and fell apart so hard that my friend almost hurt his back! Let me explain that what broke was the METAL support/legs of the chair, not the wood! The metal bent and broke as if it's butter!

All of the Andre Rieu concerts are amazing and both visually and musically ""world class."" They are a wonderful variety of vocal and instrumental, classical, standards, seasonal, and patriotic.

The people who were there that night will never forget the joy and beauty of that evening, and you can see it on their faces.","If you don't have an Andre Rieu concert DVD, let this be your first.

1,A mellow masterpiece,"I borrowed this off a friend a while ago and only got a brief time to listen to it, but within that time I realised this needed to be part of my collection. This CD is ranked as highly as Chemical Brothers, Orbital, Fat Boys Slim and Air and contains a little bit of each of them in each track. I recently stubbled across this beauty about a week ago in a seconds shop and was amazed to see that someone had decided to sell it. Since then I haven't been able to stop playing it.

1,Unbelievably Good,"This is easily the best set in what is likely the most influential series being produced today. Studio K7 gives dj's the freedom to explore the music that has influenced their styles, and the results have been incredible. On this set, K&D take listeners on an incredible, ininterrupted journey through the depths of downtempo music. All I can say is WOW - to call this music smooth would be an understatement. The music is downright enthralling without demanding any energy on the part of the listener. True to Eno's conception of what great music can be, this set fits any occasion and mindfullness; it can be appreciated for its own beauty or used to set a mood. I have to be careful with when I play this disc, otherwise it would never leave my deck.","This is easily the best set in what is likely the most influential series being produced today.

Gross' ""Models"", this book is a natural progression. I just love her witty, funny, poignant, defiant and in-your face writing style. I literally didn't put down this book until I read the last pages 5 hours later! I know I will re-read it over and over again, and of course, the accompanying photos are a bonus! Janice, if your are reading this, I (as well as many others) will be waiting for the follow up and please include some of the photographs that you have taken. I'd love to see your work at the other end of the camera!All in all, a most satisfying book.","I've always been intrigued by this doe-eyed, full lipped exotic beauty when she started appearing in magazines during the late '70s.

I don't think many people remember that episode to much i too wish that the U.S. english dub crew would've restored that episode to its proper place during the 1st season.Though I do give this DVD set 5 star rating above and beyond great job to the ViZ people on releasing this set I wish you would re-release the johto series this way.Misty is deffinetly my # 1 favorite leading lady all the way.","I reccomend this box set for people who remember this season 14  years back in 1998 this will truly bring back a bunch of childhood memories from Ash Ketchum's earlier days as a Pokemon trainer ,and the golden years of the show's success.

Rock Wit U is by far my fav song on the album...it's my summer song at the moment...I luv cruisin with it on. Breakup2 makeup, I Found Lovin', and Then Ya Gone are also favs i have on this cd. If u luv Ashanti and her angelic voice, this is a must buy cd. If you're expecting there to be lots of rap on this album like the last, you're out of luck though. There's no Ja Rule on this album. [Santana] is the only rapper on this cd, and unlike the last cd, the swear words are edited out of this one. All in all though, this cd is rockin and is gonna be my summer cd.","Well, Ashanti has done it again! Although this cd may not be as good as the first, it's still worth the .

0,Miss Jackson...needs to lose the nasty,"I was so excited for Janet's new album, and when I heard the new single I was ready for more. It is a shame that I've found ""All For You"" a little disappointing. The first set of tracks are amazing, with ""Come On Get Up"" being the best song on the album. After that she dives head long into ballads of blantant sexual flavor. I don't have a problem with Janet telling us that she feels ""juicy"", but it is over done. ""Velvet Rope""(her best album yet!) had the whole sex thing going on. The difference on ""All For You"" is that is seems misplaced. Janet needs to find some new material to work with. Cause when she sticks to less risque themes, the girl rocks. ""Someone To Call My Lover"", is terrific, and ""Trust A Try"" really makes you sweat. ""All For You"" is worth the money to buy it. Janet can't please everyone and I am sure that there are millions of people who don't agree with me, but that's the beauty of life-you are free to form your own opinions!","I was so excited for Janet's new album, and when I heard the new single I was ready for more.

1,The Ugliest Most Beautiful Album You'll Ever Hear,"Both swaggering and glib, Street Hassle finds Reed hitting the peak of his shady career as a poseur and gutter songwriter. Over a rambunctious and inebriating, messy performance, Reed and band recreate an atmosphere of uncertainty tainted by dark humor and acid wit. Every song here is driven by Reed's cruelly sardonic takes on life and a rough jazz/rock blend that sounds positively filthy and catchy, every hook struggling to surface through a mire of bass, droning guitar, and saxes. Street Hassle reeks of the rot of New York and sounds like a massive waste spill that is both freightening and alluring. Whereas previous albums tried to capture Reed's musical persona by means of glitter productions, Street Hassle ironically displays his sophistication in an ugly, swirling fusion that is more spontaneous and improvisational than anything he's done. Your definition of beauty will never be the same after this.","Both swaggering and glib, Street Hassle finds Reed hitting the peak of his shady career as a poseur and gutter songwriter.

1,Beautiful...,"I'd have to say that this is one of the more blatantly emotional Placebo albums. You can really tell that Brian wrote some of these songs coming from a very dark place, and I think that he conveys that beautifully. ""Burger Queen"" & ""My Sweet Prince"" are excellent examples of the darker stuff, while ""Allergic"" & ""Scared of Girls"" show how the well the band can play slightly harder material.Yes, there are a few songs where it's quite obvious as to who they have been inspired by. Such as ""You Don't Care About Us"", very Cure. And yes, Brian did wear alot of makeup and women's clothing in those days, and he still wears makeup. But just as with Marilyn Manson people pay far more attention to a band's ""image"" then they do to actually LISTENING to lyrics and music. This is a very well-done album and I highly suggest it to anyone with an interest in Placebo.","I'd have to say that this is one of the more blatantly emotional Placebo albums.

1,Downright moving!,"I almost never like modern songs that involve beautiful voices because most of them just feel fake and don't mean a damn thing to me. Sarah McLachlan is one of the few that gets WAY past this, her voice is no less than amazing and she obviously sings straight from her heart! I rarely express any emotions visibly, yet whenever I'm on edge and I listen to almost any of the songs on this CD tears come streaming down my face. I can't think of an album that I would recommend more to someone who wants beauty and honesty mixed to perfection.","I almost never like modern songs that involve beautiful voices because most of them just feel fake and don't mean a damn thing to me.

1,Poignant!,"Poignant! This comic book version of Richard III, staring Ian McKellan, is actually an extremely profound statement about our times. Jeeps replace horses, tommy guns replace spears, and hanging replaces beheading as the setting takes place in London, swinging away the 1930s in midst of a fascist coup. Richard III is beautifully portrayed by McKellan: deformed, merciless and treacherous. The movie is teaming with sex, drugs, and violence. The style is reminiscent of the modern version of Romeo and Juliet staring Leonardo Dicaprio, though Richard III is more cartoonish: bombs explode, women ware impeccable makeup with red nails, and love is shallow. The director successfully catches the mood and spirit of Shakespeares Richard of Gloucester, all using the authentic dialogue with few cuts and making a poignant parallel between Richard and Hitler.","Poignant!

0,Unlike other Disney-Soundtracks,"If you liked the Lion King soundtrack, the Beauty And The Beast soundtrack and the Hunchback score (like I did), you might think that the Tarzan-music should be enjoyable, too. However, Marc Mancina does not even come close to the standart Hans Zimmer set with 'Lion King' and the whole album sounds more like a Phil Collins-CD than a soundtrack (with only 3 songs being written by Mancina alone). You'll be surprised not to find any song performed by the Tarzan-cast--and might as well listen to your older Collins-tapes!","If you liked the Lion King soundtrack, the Beauty And The Beast soundtrack and the Hunchback score like I did, you might think that the Tarzan-music should be enjoyable, too.

1,Dark and Disturbing: A must for Reznor fans!,"I was shocked and amazed. This video gave me a chill and at the same time kept my undivided attetion. The live footage shows a behind the scene look at what goes on behind the curtain as well as a surge of Trent Reznor's industrial power as a musician. Look for scenes that contain Marilyn Manson playing wit Reznor before being signed as a solo artist to Interscope. It's hard to believe he actually looks normal without the clown-like makeup he wears today. The second tape contains uncut and unedited videos which takes you on a journey inside of Trents head. Some of the videos had aired on MTV, but in a tame form. Put your seatbelt on before checking out these uncut scenes. Especially the video for ""Happiness in Slavery."" This video could give a nightmare to anyone. So if your into the gothic, industrial metal music of Trent Reznor, please do not pass this video up!","I was shocked and amazed.

1,An absolute gem,"Along with Gerard Lesne's recording of Bononcini cantatas on Virgin (now reissued as librettoless budget double), this is one of the best monuments to the older of the Bononcini brothers. The recording dates from 1988 and Cristina Miatello is on typically fine form.The only niggle (as always with Tactus) is the lack of English translations with the Italian texts, but you can always lie back and enjoy the beauty of Ms. Miatello's warbling. Tactus are to be congratulated for digging out many gems from the 17th Century... cantatas by Conti, Leo, and of course Vivaldi, among them. It's worth noting here Tactus tribute to the younger Bononcini brother - The Decapitation of John the Baptist - conducted by Sandro Volta, recorded 1999. Not everyone's taste perhaps but a reminder that all musical families mixed sacred and secular at the time.","Along with Gerard Lesne's recording of Bononcini cantatas on Virgin now reissued as librettoless budget double, this is one of the best monuments to the older of the Bononcini brothers.

1,The fallacies of hype,"This film is one of the most gripping and tormenting films I've watched, even though it's decidedly difficult for me to relate to the people and scenes in Falls City; I am a student attending a New England prep school for intellecutally gifted girls from mostly socially prominent families, and it's hard for me to imagine squandering precious time in bars, loitering around in squalid settings without a single purpose in life.Also, I take exception to many reviewers' praises about Hilary Swank's acting. She's a good actress, but she's no where close to the breathtaking talents possessed and displayed by the likes of Emily Watson, Isabelle Adjani, Cate Blanchett, Natasha Regnier. Nor does she has the incandescent beauty of a Julie Delpy.","This film is one of the most gripping and tormenting films I've watched, even though it's decidedly difficult for me to relate to the people and scenes in Falls City I am a student attending a New England prep school for intellecutally gifted girls from mostly socially prominent families, and it's hard for me to imagine squandering precious time in bars, loitering around in squalid settings without a single purpose in life.Also, I take exception to many reviewers' praises about Hilary Swank's acting.

As regards the majority of the kinds of people who will flock to such a film, isn't ""Boys Don't Cry"" banging on an already open door?

Who is honestly challenged by this complacent examination of homophobia in small town, white trash America? As regards the majority of the kinds of people who will flock to such a film, isn't Boys Don't Cry banging on an already open door? There's no real conflict of views, since one side is obviously sympathetic and advanced, the other benighted and beneath contempt. Neither the skill of the acting nor the technical polish of the photography and direction can remove the inevitable boredom that always afflicts tales of Giant the Jack killer."
1,A MUST HAVE,"I, too, have considered this album one of the most beautiful I have ever listened to--also in the top 5 or 3 of my all time favorites. Perhaps the beauty of the music is a reflection of the special relationship between Baaba Maal and Mansour Seck, his blind boyhood friend. Baaba Maal brings Seck on tour with him all over the world--it's quite something to see how this friendship has endured through Maal's rise to fame.","I, too, have considered this album one of the most beautiful I have ever listened to--also in the top 5 or 3 of my all time favorites.

1,"Lovely & Practical, but marred by Immortal Glue","These are beautiful glasses. The sides are thinner than some I've had in the past, but the bottoms are thick and the entire piece is clear as glass. However! I'm giving them only 4 stars because that glass-like beauty is spoiled by the glue beneath the two labels. Nothing I tried (hot sudsy water, glass cleaner, even Goo Gone!) could completely remove the albeit clear but greasy residue. Consequently, on opposing sides of each glass are two smeary marks. Steel wool would likely remove them ... them AND the plastic. So, bottom line is, I love 'em but I can't clean 'em!","These are beautiful glasses.

What source material is used here is anybody's guess, but it could have been unearthed as part of the dead sea scrolls because the sound quality is so horrendous. Furthermore, most of the music here is certainly not well known enough to warrant being titled ""all the best"". Painful and unlistenable, avoid this CD like the plague.

0,I didn't like it.,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I was younger then, but I was very scared. The whole plot of the movie, (as I remember it) was about these girls in a beauty pagent. the part that scared me was that these girls were trying to kill each other, literally! I thought it was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I still think that. I would not reccomend this movie to people with younger children.","I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters.

0,"Some decent performaces, but overall a rather mediocre effort","Ted Danson is pretty good as a business exec who becomes very attached to his father, played by Jack Lemmon. Lemmon himself is also not bad as the aging father, but the movie itself is full of contrived scenes that are supposed to be heartwarming, but come across as predictable and sometimes ludicrous. Also, I was rather displeased with Lemmon's makeup, which doesn't seem very realistic (I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar!).","Ted Danson is pretty good as a business exec who becomes very attached to his father, played by Jack Lemmon.

0,Bloated and pretentious,"So many people are enthralled with Proulx's style, which I find maddeningly self-serving and completely devoid of substance. Her addiction to metaphor and superfluous adjectives makes her writing ""lyrical"" to some, but I think it's a sloppy mess. Ah, if only real critics like Rebecca West were still around to give writers like Ms. Proulx the reprimanding she deserves for writing in such an unfocused way, eager to impress through vocabulary rather than lucid imagery or concentrated characterization. Many times the images she concocts are contradictory, and simply don't make sense. If you want style, beauty, and insight, read the master with whom she shares the first four letters of her name. There you will find genius.","So many people are enthralled with Proulx's style, which I find maddeningly self-serving and completely devoid of substance.

1,Great Conditioner for someone looking to go organic,"I have been using Giovanni's Magnetic line since I found out it has a very low hazard rating from the Environmental Working Group's website cosmeticdatabase.com It does not contain SLS or any other harsh chemicals and has a very pleasant fragrance. It definitely makes your hair feel smoother and softer. It does not build up in your hair over time and is a great daily conditioner for long hair, or really any hair length or type for that matter. I highly recommend the matching Giovanni Magnetic Shampoo to go with this conditioner. You wont be displeased, especially for the price, its a great product.","I have been using Giovanni's Magnetic line since I found out it has a very low hazard rating from the Environmental Working Group's website cosmeticdatabase.com It does not contain SLS or any other harsh chemicals and has a very pleasant fragrance.

It's frustrating because I've formatted kindle books and always go back to read through to make sure these very simple cosmetic problems aren't there.And for the price, I'm disappointed to get such a presentation of one of my favorite authors.So long story short: the story is good but the format is lacking.

It's been banged like hell, but cosmetically, it still looks great! There's maybe two scratches on the glass, but that's my fault, not the watch's.

1,You must not live without this book!,"The Witches of Eileannan is an experience not to be missed. Enchanting, bewitching and enthralling are just a few of the words that come to mind. To my surprise, I was unable to put this book down. Brutality and beauty compete at every turn to create the level of tension needed to hold a complex world together - a delicate balance that at times makes Forsyth's fantasies resonate with reality. The borders between fantasy and our ""real"" world appear so flimsy that concepts such as witchcraft and dragons do not seem so fantastical after all. I have read Pool of Two Moons and Cursed Towers and as Forsyth develops her worlds, meticulous research and innate wisdom enhance this resonance. More importantly, its a damn good read!","The Witches of Eileannan is an experience not to be missed. Enchanting, bewitching and enthralling are just a few of the words that come to mind.

1,Excellent Art Book,"Both the artwork and the text in this book are outstanding. It would make a great ""coffee table"" book simply because of its beauty, but it offers so much more for the serious student of art. For the artist, it offers an insight into the ideas and development of Degas as an artist and a view into his world. The reproductions, while never as dramatic as the real paintings, are true to color and intensity and cover a wide range of Degas' work. The text is well researched and written and covers both the biographical and artistic aspects of the man.","Both the artwork and the text in this book are outstanding.

0,Not Erotic,"Perhaps I'm jaded, but it takes a little more than repetitive acts of S & M to get me off. Also, Anne Rice needs to understand a little about the subject on which she writes.

If you're reading this review in contemplation of purchasing the book, let me sum the plot up for you. Prince Charming takes Beauty to his S & M castle.

0,Not your typical fairy tale,"I bought these books expecting some romance, what i didn't expect was all the abuse that Beauty deals with. All of the spanking and sexual torture just really turned me off. I can not see how anyone would except being treated like this. Maybe that's why i can not get into the BDSM lifestyle. I have read other BDSM books after Rice's Beauty trilogy and i found that i liked them a whole lot more than her books.And i also hated the fact that Beauty was just this mindless sex addict who went from man to man and the Prince at the beginning of the first book was barely in the story. She loved him and then quickly went onto another man and loved him, then went to another one. I know its just a story but i just hated Beauty by the end of the books. I read most of the first book, and i skimmed the other two.

0,Horrible. Dangerous. Garbage.,"Horrible because the underaged ""Beauty"" is repeatedly raped and humiliated by the biggest, most insecure, likely small-penised dirtbag on the planet.

This crap goes on in underdeveloped countries and we cry foul. Why is this considered a fun, fantasy read? It's garbage. [...].

The story takes a different turn and the writing moves from a rant about virtue to a real story. Venice is beautifully depicted and Aschenbach becomes a real, brilliant, tortured human being. That's what I liked.","I liked and disliked this book. Mann has his character, Aschenbach, preach a little more than I like, preaching his thoughts about beauty and writing and control.

1,Wonderful story,"This book was a book club choice this year and if it weren't for the book club I may not have picked it up, but I am happy I did. It is a wonderfully descriptive story of the beauty of the West Coast of British Columbia. The author is amazing in her desire to sail the shores without a man aboard, something I don't think was common in the early 1900's. A must read.","This book was a book club choice this year and if it weren't for the book club I may not have picked it up, but I am happy I did.

0,Drying,"Unlike the other reviewers, I found it to be very drying after using 2 large bars. My lips became chapped and dry. My whole family had been using it for 4 weeks when even my preschooler and husband started to complain how itchy they were. My skin is oily and it did remove all of the oil and then some! When I stopped using the bar, my lips went back to normal and we all stopped itching. We're not particularly sensitive or allergic to anything. I really wanted to like this soap, especially since it received great ratings on the cosmetic database for purity. Initially, we loved everything about it. Over time, dryness became a huge issue. I did give it 2 stars anyway because it does last a long time, the ingredients are pure, and the smell is pleasant.","Unlike the other reviewers, I found it to be very drying after using 2 large bars.

0,it will sit on the shelf for the rest of time,"This long-anticipated album is just another disappointment in a year of disappointments. The chaotic beauty found in Trail of Dead's previous releases has gone. The song-writing is weak, the lyrics are just bad, and Jason is unlistenable. After 5 complete listens (sober, driving, at work, lit, and now drunk) the album has been tucked into my over-flowing CD rack, never to be seen again. Next to it is buried that lame new Faint disc, the uninspired Interpol album, and that boring new Blonde Redhead release. A decade ago, I never would have thought that Sonic Youth would be making the most vital, beautiful, creative, and inspired music in the year 2004/05. Save your money on Worlds Apart and buy something classic instead, like Echo's timeless and beautiful ""Heaven Up Here"", or maybe that one Sonic Youth album that you just don't have.","This long-anticipated album is just another disappointment in a year of disappointments.

1,Light and shadow,"This book delivered 110%. I was looking for instruction on how to create simple paper shades. What I found in this book is that and much, much more. The explanations of the interplay of light and paper, the surprisingly simple processes to create subtle beauty are fantastic. All of the projects in the book use basic skills and tools, the line drawings are very easy to follow and picture the process very well. The photographs are beautiful and inspiring.","This book delivered 110. I was looking for instruction on how to create simple paper shades. What I found in this book is that and much, much more.

1,Citizen's men's chronograph watch,"This watch came super fast and it is a beauty! There are some reviews about its inaacuracy with time but if you follow the instructions and expose it to sunlight for 40 hours (for full battery charge), there should not be any problems with time keeping. This watch clearly states that it's battery runs off sunlight. I exposed it accordingly and so far, have not had one issue with it. This Citizen watch may be an older model but you cannot tell by looking at it. It is very well made, has a nice weight to it and the blue face adds to its elegance. I am sure my hubby will be as happy as I am when I give him this birthday gift. Best of all....the price can't be beat! Im very happy with this purchase! :)","This watch came super fast and it is a beauty!

0,Faerie Tale Theatre: Sleeping Beauty,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I've enjoyed many others from the Faerie Tale Theatre collection, so I was expecting to be more like the others. It was not very romantic or uplifting, as I expected Sleeping Beauty to be. It was comical, but were a couple parts that had sexual inuendos (sp?) and I would have been embarrassed if I had watched this for the first time with family or friends. I bought this movie thinking it would be a cute, romantic fairy tale that my family and I would enjoy. But I don't know if I even want my young children to watch it. Overall, it was okay, but did not at all meet my expectations.","I was very disappointed with this movie.

1,Beautiful and Meaningful,"My fear was that this would be a ""politically correct"" gimmick deck.My criteria for a deck are beauty and authenticity.

0,"Awful, breathtakingly bad movie","My wife was the smart one and slept through most of it.There are so many memorably dumb things in this movie. The characters spend at least 45 minutes of the running time walking through the same 3 tunnels looking at stuff. A lady scientist cuts her belly all the way across, including her uterus, pulls out a huge alien, then gets stapled together and walks around like she hasn't just had major surgery. Another scientist plays with a threatening snake alien like it's a squirrel, then is completely shocked when it eats his face off. And, to top it all off, there's a young actor inexplicably made up in the worst old man makeup I've seen since Ed Wood was alive. Instead of using an actual older actor, the director made up his nephew or something to play the part.It's not the dollar and a half I wasted renting it that drove me to Amazon to post a review, it was the 2 hours of my life I will never get to live over.","My wife was the smart one and slept through most of it.There are so many memorably dumb things in this movie.

1,Better than I Thought,"I really didn't expect much when I picked up this book; afterall, the title is very misleading. But after reading the book, the title makes sense. A Great and Terrible Beauty is fairly predictable, but the elements of fantasy and gothic moments make the story unique. I enjoyed reading it more than I thought I would and I have to say that this is an interesting novel that will appeal to teenage readers. I can't wait for the next installment to come out.","I really didn't expect much when I picked up this book afterall, the title is very misleading. But after reading the book, the title makes sense.

0,Yikes!,"Kudos for Harlan to keep writing. His debut was a mess. How many times can you extol a person's beauty over and over again? Gag me already! There are passages that you just cannot bear. May be reading the book is easier than listening to the book on tape. Luckily there was a forwarding button, taking small jumps forward. But still there are better things to do with your time even if you are stuck in a car for a 13 hour drive. Why would anyone make a decision like the main character did? It is very unlikely unless you're psychotic. The main man was not portrayed as such.I'd pass on this one. If you are going on a long drive always bring a few backup books on tape, you never know when you hit a poor one.","Kudos for Harlan to keep writing. His debut was a mess.

0,Tries too hard to be clever.,"Little Children starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson thinks it's the clever cousin of American Beauty. I was expecting a thought-provoking and intelligent look at married couples in crisis - what I got was a bunch of self-important adults acting like greedy babies (now I know why the film is called Little Children). Whoever the narrator was of this film really got on my nerves after the first 15 minutes. Wilson has still not impressed as a serious actor while Jennifer Connelly (a true talent) barely has any scenes. Winslet is good as usual but I found it very difficult to try and feel sympathetic for her character or situation. The graphic sex scenes didn't help much, this film was a major disappointment, I'd skip this one!","Little Children starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson thinks it's the clever cousin of American Beauty.

1,beautiful,"This is perhaps my favorite book of all from my childhood. Periodically I reread it as an adult and my appreciation grows every time. It is so unassuming, like the character of Martha, but the themes are big: the meaning of friendship, the art of finding beauty in life, the winding paths of growing up. The characters could step out of the page, the emotions are deep and true, and the end is so simple and quietly heartbreaking, but at the same time the kind of sorrow that is full of life and joy and passion. ZKS was truly inspired when she wrote this. In my opinion it is perfect.","This is perhaps my favorite book of all from my childhood.

1,a brilliant and lyrical masterpiece,"For this reviewer, ""The Painted Bird,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" Styron's book have a transcendent power that is undeniable.Beautifully written (keep a dictionary handy, unless your name is William F. Buckley, Jr.), Styron mixes hilarious passages with the tragic narrative and slowly reveals secrets of Sophie and Nathan.I first read this book when it came out for a college course on Literature and The Holocaust. Its depth and beauty still floors me. Styron is one of our great American writers, and this is a true 5-star masterpiece. Also: read the recently released biography on Styron to get an in-depth look at how and who he based his 'Sophie' characters on.","For this reviewer, The Painted Bird, To Kill A Mockingbird, and The Catcher in the Rye, Styron's book have a transcendent power that is undeniable.Beautifully written keep a dictionary handy, unless your name is William F.

0,Another mediocre gay comedy...,"I honestly wish I could say that ""Bear City"" is not your typical indie gay comedy--and indeed some elements of the film differentiate it from most of the other gay indie comedies that seem to sprout up like toadstools these days. But those very elements that distinguish this film--the focus on bear culture, the bashful twink who ""comes out"" as a bear-lover, and the depiction of love and sex among gay men who do not resemble Abercrombie & Fitch models--are so thoroughly transformed into standardized gay tropes that the movie is ultimately stripped of its originality and settles into a formulaic, plot-less pattern of mildly amusing vignettes with no real focus or story structure. We are ultimately left with vapid platitudes assuring us that bears don't need to conform to queer norms of beauty in order to find love and happiness. And it takes them only 90 minutes to deliver this profound and provocative message (YAWN).","I honestly wish I could say that Bear City is not your typical indie gay comedy--and indeed some elements of the film differentiate it from most of the other gay indie comedies that seem to sprout up like toadstools these days.

0,Loved the book...hated the television adaptation,"Loved the book...hated the television adaptation. But what else is new, I usually hate a movie or television adaptation of a novel. When will I learn to stop watching them is a better question. This one really sucked. The characters and the whole tone of this production were completely unlike that of the novel. Such a disappointment. The producers of this trash decided to place more emphasis on a character that played a much smaller role in the second part of the novel, and decided to build the entire story around her pathetic and uninteresting life. Then they inserted additional characters that did not appear in the book and drastically changed the plot. The main character is now an unsympathetic twit of a woman who cares only about her career to the detriment of all else. The wonderful story has been butchered...like a pretty woman who has a botched cosmetic surgical procedure and is now an ugly hag.","Loved the book...hated the television adaptation.

1,fresh feel,"I'm in my early 50's with blotchy, pale skin. I just started using this moisturizer a few weeks ago. It has a smooth silky feel and goes on very evenly. It makes my skin feel refreshed. The smell is luscious (my husbands likes it too) and I like the sheen that adds a nice glow.I've been wearing it under makeup. Not sure if that is OK by design but I use a primer over it and I think my foundation stays on a bit longer.","I'm in my early 50's with blotchy, pale skin.

1,When the Beauty's Gone,"If you can find it, buy the When the Beauty's Gone EP first. It has the original (and better) versions of the best 5 songs on this disc. Then get this one and the updates to those songs are an interesting change, and the rest of the tracks are pretty good too. I'm giving it 4 stars because I expected more after that 5 star EP. Hopefully the album they're working on now will be all that I expect from them.B.","If you can find it, buy the When the Beauty's Gone EP first.

1,Simply one of the best albums ever,"The music of Jobim first hit our shores in the 1950s when Bossa Nova came to us. Jobim was one of the most artful and prolific of its creators. Since then his music has been covered and interpreted in many fashions , in the 60s it spawned many a commercial jingle, big band interpretations abounded over the years as well as electrified versions but the true essence of the beauty of his music is best appreciated when the accompamiment is sparse , and acoustic. This album is the most artful rendering of all so far. I'd give it ten stars if I could.","The music of Jobim first hit our shores in the 1950s when Bossa Nova came to us.

1,A Mastepiece of consort music,"I must thank the Rough Guide for recommending this perfectly played consort music by Phantasm of music for six viols by William Lawes. Even though this an expensive imported CD it is worth the expense. As was the style at the time they were composed there are dance movements and using melancholy music. Unlike with their other disc of Lawes with fewer viols, the complexity off these sets is quite overwhelming but just as beautiful to listen to. I was quite overwhelmed at several points by the beauty and was brought to tears Wow this is wonderful music. . I would highly recommend this CD to all listeners of Classical music as well as their other disk .as well the Royal Suites","I must thank the Rough Guide for recommending this perfectly played consort music by Phantasm of music for six viols by William Lawes.

1,Good Stuff!!!,"After realizing two years ago that cosmetics are not FDA regulated, meaning anyone can put anything in cosmetics eventhough a high percentage of what we put on our skin is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream, I decided I needed to research ALL of the products I use. The Body Shop's Aloe line is great, their rating is good on skin deep, they do not test their products on animals, they are not outrageously overpriced and they are easy to purchase. I've been using them for two years and I've been very happy. The person who said this moisturizer had a bad smell could not be more wrong. In fact, this moisturizer has virtually no smell at all. That comment was so preposterous that I was compelled to write a review to set the record straight.","After realizing two years ago that cosmetics are not FDA regulated, meaning anyone can put anything in cosmetics eventhough a high percentage of what we put on our skin is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream, I decided I needed to research ALL of the products I use.

1,This is a book that reminds one to stop and smell the roses.,"This is a wonderfully written book about a Native American woman who goes out into the desert and observes the wonders and beauty of nature around her. She records what she finds fascinating and creates her OWN holidays or celebrations. One day she may observe a green cloud and call it Green Cloud Day. On another day, she may observe a shooting star and call it Star Day. She gets outside of herself and observes wonderous things that may only be seen once in a lifetime!","This is a wonderfully written book about a Native American woman who goes out into the desert and observes the wonders and beauty of nature around her.

0,it was great...when I had insomnia,"I have read all Jane Austen's novels and have scooped up every movie adaptation out there. They're for the most part totally delightful.This miniseries (which I bought as a set with all six BBC miniseries) is awful. I can't understand all the five star reviews.The lighting, the acting, the makeup, the editing; all just plain terrible. I forced myself to watch Northanger Abbey (which is so bad, it's funny to watch) and a couple years later worked up the courage to try Mansfield Park. It put me to sleep three or four nights in a row. It felt like a penance for some sin, but I was determined to watch it to the bitter end.I wouldn't recommend these series to my worst enemy.","I have read all Jane Austen's novels and have scooped up every movie adaptation out there.

1,Are we watching the same movie?,"I have read all the reviews and I just can't believe what people have written. This was a great movie. Yes it had terrible cinematography and the clothing was not that eye-catching but it was extremely well-written and I found the acting more than tolerable. I didn't have a problem with Sylvestra's portrayal of Fanny. I thought she did a good job even if she was not handsome. Fanny was not supposed to be a great beauty. I love the actor who played Edmund. He made me fall head over heels in love with the character. I think the storyline adhered well to the book. I also liked the portrayals of Fanny's uncle and Mary Crawford even though I despised the character. The ending I will admit was disappointing. After a long movie it was not enough of a payoff. Otherwise, this is highly recommended.","I have read all the reviews and I just can't believe what people have written. This was a great movie.

If I had listened to clips I would never have bought this awful, misguided album. I absolutely adore Sasha Argov and was at first disappointed, and then angered by this recording. It seems like somebody thought it would be a good idea to take Sasha Argov's classic songs and give them bizarre instrumental arrangements ""complemented"" by singers who cannot hold a tune. It's almost as though this album were an experiment in trying to prove that even the greatest songs can be destroyed if you really try hard enough. Listen to the double-tracked off-pitch vocal on track two; it's literally painful to hear.Do not buy this album. Try to get hold of something like Matti Caspi singing Sasha Argov.

0,From Rage to Disgust,"This is the story of a poor African-American girl whose Caucasian features, physical beauty and mindless ambition allowed her to escape her social class and race to become a weather-girl in Chicago, runway model, successful celebrity hob-nobber, wife to corrupt Secretary of Defense William Cohen (her third husband), and a member of the power-elite...with whom she shares a complete lack of concern for the plight of the oppressed. She seems thrilled that she is now one of ""them"". The real woman behind the text, who alleges outrage at the way blacks are treated in this country and recounts her struggles with racism until she finally became white, is an Ivana Trump clone with some pseudo-leftist political rhetoric thrown on top. She is a plastic non-person who uses the power she acquired from her sheepish husband to engage in fits of self-aggrandizing onanism. But other than that, it's not a bad book.","This is the story of a poor African-American girl whose Caucasian features, physical beauty and mindless ambition allowed her to escape her social class and race to become a weather-girl in Chicago, runway model, successful celebrity hob-nobber, wife to corrupt Secretary of Defense William Cohen her third husband, and a member of the power-elite...with whom she shares a complete lack of concern for the plight of the oppressed.

1,A worthwhile bargain,"This recording on Naxos of two of the most famous suites of Stravinsky ballets is one that is surprisingly first-rate for a bargain CD of an obscure orchestra. The Firebird Suite is played with both skill and beauty by the orchestra. King Katchei's Infernal Dance is the highlight of this suite, played with great fervor and relentlessness. The real gem on the disk however is the Rite of Spring. A daunting piece for any orchestra to tackle the BRT handles it with the utmost expertise. The ensemble has a great cohesive sound throughout and never misses a beat. As a whole, the ensemble performs the Rite of Spring in a way that is satisfying on both the technical level and musical level. This CD is one of those rare bargains that has more value than its price, and is highly recommended for bargain hunters everywhere.","This recording on Naxos of two of the most famous suites of Stravinsky ballets is one that is surprisingly first-rate for a bargain CD of an obscure orchestra.

1,Perfect,"The Instinct, believe it or not, is even more riveting than the band's first release, since the mixes are more ""up front"" and you get the satisfaction of hearing their songs while feeling as if you are seeing them live. This album is evidence that if you give a strong band time to perfect their sound, they can become great in no time.

1,Updike's Theological-Philosophical Best,"Updike IN THE BEAUTY OF THE LILLIES brillantly presents the grand theme that permeates the Updike canon, the displacement of religion in American with that which cannot transcend. The replacement/displacement theme is immediate in IN THE BEAUTY--the vacuum created by the collapse of religion in American is filled by the movies. But, the replacement proves in the end to be hollow. It cannot transcend, and the result is disillusionment with both religion and the movies.A great read and thought-provoking. This is Updike at his philosophical best.","Updike IN THE BEAUTY OF THE LILLIES brillantly presents the grand theme that permeates the Updike canon, the displacement of religion in American with that which cannot transcend.

1,Very Good compilation,"All of the other reviewers have covered the basics of the album, which is fantastic! I thought I would relay a story as to how Clannad and Bono hooked up. It seems Bono was driving around the outskirts of Belfast when Harry's Game came on the radio. He was so mesmerized by the beauty of the song and Diedre's voice that he lost his concentration and drifted into oncoming traffic and was nearly in a head-on accident! He swerved off of the road and into a ditch and spent the next minute or so in the ditch listening to the end of the song. After he returned home safetly, he phoned his manager, Paul McGinley up and had him get in touch with Clannad. They eventually got in the studio and recorded In a Lifetime.","All of the other reviewers have covered the basics of the album, which is fantastic!

But I found no beauty in Siegmund or any of the Valkyries.There should be a law against any production that makes a travesty out of the magnificent farewell of Wotan to his daughter.
1,Beautiful Poetry Wonderfully Read By Ron Perlman!,This is a really good CD. Beauty and The Beast was one of my favorite TV shows and when I heard about this CD I bought it.

0,Puh-leeze...instant classic it ain't!,"This is without doubt Prince's most flawed record... yet I give it two stars because the music is irreproachably fabulous. The lyrics, on the other hand, are the worst sort of prosletyzing, small-minded, racist, superstitious dreck. I for one do not appreciate being preached at, especially not by a Jehovah's Witness-wannabe who's gone mad in his old age. What happened to the little androgynous man who sang for all races, sexes, sexualities, and creeds? What happened to the simple ""God is Love"" of Lovesexy? These days those messages of hope are gone, replaced by complicated and nonsensical theology, racist remarks about whites and Jews, and sexist garbage instructing women to ""submit"" to their men. It's a damned shame that he's drifted so far from the beauty he once produced. If only there was a version of this album with no lyrics...","This is without doubt Prince's most flawed record... yet I give it two stars because the music is irreproachably fabulous.

1,This book taught me everything I know...,I have had this book for about ten years and it taught me the basics of...well everything beauty. It gives you clear steps on how and why to apply all types of makeup. My two sisters and I have read it so many times that some of the pages have come loose but I will still keep it to reference it for years to come. The celebrity transformations are amazing! I never knew Courtney Love could look normal....I would highly recommend this book to a person looking for guidance or maybe as a gift for the girl who over shapes her eyebrows (jk). It would also be helpful for a young teen new to make up.,I have had this book for about ten years and it taught me the basics of...well everything beauty.

They have an answering machine set up that they obviously never check. I have yet to receive a call back, and it's been a month. I guess all I can do is keep trying??? NOT WORTH $150!!!!

1,Moving and well written,"The story of the Dalai Lama and his people as told by His Holiness is charmingly written. (He uses words like 'whilst and amongst'.)We follow the very young playful boy from his very modest home in the Tibetian province of Amdo to the capital of Lhasa where his education as a Buddhist monk begins. He relates much detail about the rich culture and beauty of Tibet; however he is honest about it's isolation and failure to keep up with a more modern world.As he tells of the miliary and political struggle with China, one can almost feel the tension mount. The account of his escape into exile is exciting, yet sad. The destruction of Tibet, the atrocities upon its people, and the genocide still being committed there is more than sad. Yet, the Dalai Lama does not hate. He has compassion even for those who have caused the suffering of the Tibetian people.Great book. I recommend it.","The story of the Dalai Lama and his people as told by His Holiness is charmingly written.

1,a new career in a new town,"Bill 'Smog' Callahan's 4-tracking days are far behind, and only for the better, it seems. Each album since 1995's Wild Love has offered significant improvement (or at least new wrinkles) on Callahan's dry, stark, and occasionally morbid observational songwriting techniques. The big variation on this album, which perhaps explains the slightly altered billing (as ""(smog)""), is that Callahan employs a full band on every song, or more precisely, one band, rather than a rotating crew, as on past albums. This includes Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo on guitar, US Maple's Pat Samson on drums, and avant-garde oboeist Kyle Bruckmann. The result is perhaps the tightest, most cohesive album Callahan has ever delivered. As always, the outward prickliness of his music only serves to set those frequent moments of instrumental beauty and lyrical clarity (""God does not answer / This type of prayer"") in sharper contrast. Another American classic, from a true national treasure.","Bill 'Smog' Callahan's 4-tracking days are far behind, and only for the better, it seems.

1,Subtle and Beautiful,"I've noticed some wonderfully divergent comments about the film, here. The reason the film is so great is that it truly does offer a multitude of possibilities. For me, this film was about finding beauty in the places where you least expect it. Finding beauty in a teenage sex romp, in men, in Long Island. Giles De'ath's search for beauty (and it's tragic rejection of him) is, I feel, the essence of this film and it is executed with remarkable precision and very good humor.","I've noticed some wonderfully divergent comments about the film, here.

0,I just don't get it,"Bottom line: TinkerBell can't hold a candle to traditional Disney movies like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, and certainly can't hope to compete with films like Toy Story and Shrek. The characters, plot, and dialogue are all mediocre. Usually when a movie has a four and a half star rating from almost 400 reviewers, it's a winner. But this one seemed more like a lengthy episode of a run-of-the-mill animated TV show.

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's extremely far from great! Whoever decided to use Colin Farrell to play Alexander, should be shot! He looks ridiculous with blond hair too.

1,A lyric story of the artist's youth,"This small autobiography is a poetic inspiring work. It tells of Chagall's childhood in Vitebsk and his first youthful efforts as an artist. And it also contains within it the great love story of Chagall's life with his first wife Bella. Chagall writes with intensity and strength much the way he paints. The difficulty of his early years is somehow transcended by his devotion to his artistic vocation. This is a recommended work for all those who care about the relation of the artist to his life, and of the creator of great beauty to his artistic task.","This small autobiography is a poetic inspiring work.

1,I love dermablend,"I have been using dermablend for years. I have Discoid Lupus, and I was left with very dark marks on my body after the rashes healed. I have been so self-conscience about the unsightly marks. When I found dermablend I was excited that I was finally able to wear my cute short sleeve tops and short skirts again. I mix two colors: caramel and medium. The key is to moisturize your skin before applying. Make sure the lotion is dry,then apply. I dust a little powder on first to get rid of the wetness of the lotion, then I apply the makeup evenly using a little and adding more as needed; a little goes a long way, and dont forget to blend the edges. I let it set for about 5 min, then I dust it with powder. I can swim with it and even shower and it doesn't come off until I use soap. The one con is that it does rub off on your clothes a little. I don't have any problems getting it off in the washer, but if you are trying to do a spot treatment it is hard to rub off.","I have been using dermablend for years.

Jerry sets the bag next to Kramer's door, knocks, and leaves. Kramer answers the door and happily takes the bag inside. That's kind of how I felt after after watching Sleeping Beauty, like Kramer, with Julia Leigh's garbage.","There's an episode of Seinfeld where Jerry asks George to throw out Jerry's garbage.

0,Vanilla Ripoff,"I never thought it possible, but I guess it is. Two different directors, with different actors in a different locale and THE SAME STORY. One gets it right, in this case the original and the other, well, makes a mess of it.I literally burst out laughing when Cruise did his little jump in the air to demonstrate his frustration with his team of surgeons. Cruise didn't want to play it like Edwardo Noriega so he took it to the other extreme - infantile.There was alot of that in this movie. The way in which Sophia reacts when she thinks she's in love with Cruise's character. Squeeling like a child. And to top it all off, Tom Cruise couldn't dare to hide his face under grotesque makeup (as did Edwardo Noriega in the far superior and more mature ""Abre Los Ojos"") because afterall, how else would people recognize the great Tom Cruise.And if someone can explain the title, be my guest.Two thumbs way down.","I never thought it possible, but I guess it is.

0,The worst movie ever made,"I loved Jerry Maguire and when I heard the director and star were making another movie, I was first in line.I learned something watching this movie. Life is short and there are two hours of my life that I will never get back.This is the worst movie ever made. Bar none. The plot makes no sense, Tom Cruise is horribly disfigured so there's nothing to look at. I read another review that said the plot was full of holes. That's the beauty of this movie. You won't care! You won't spend time afterwards picking out plot holes, you will just not care AT ALL. Additional time thinking about this movie will just waste more time.Glitter was a better movie. Showgirls was a better movie. Seriously. Awful.P.S. You may be thinking I'm exagerating and try watching it yourself. Don't. Horrid.

1,A charming retelling of Cinderella,"This book, though rather juvenile in appearance, is pure magic. Shirley Rousseau Murphy is adept at creating sympathetic characters with a few, well-placed descriptions. Thursey is a spirited and intelligent Cinderella who enjoys defying her greedy stepmother and hideous stepsisters who use her as a slave for their inn. Loving stories and fairy tales of all sorts, her own begins when she meets a kind goat boy named Gilly returning with the queen and prince after the war. But is he really who he seems? And though he partly plays the role of the beneficial fairy, it's ultimately up to Thursey to make her own magic come true.Simply and beautifully told, Silver Woven in My Hair was one of my first fairy tale retellings (along with Beauty by Robin McKinley) and remains one of my favorites. A pleasant companion to the equally excellent Ella Enchanted, this book is definitely worth the effort it will take to find.","This book, though rather juvenile in appearance, is pure magic.

1,Final culmination of the Oriental Adventures saga,"Ah, the ultimate culmination in the legendary Oriental Adventures series of the Forgotten Realms - this one takes the adventurers from the dreary lands of Wa, into the amazing, legendary faerie realm of Qui, never detailed before.

1,Great Film. . . period,"As someone who has seen a plenty of videos, I can safely say that this is one of the greatest of all time. It completely blows any diseny production ever created out of the water as well as most other videos I have seen. The plot is enthralling in that it is not clear cut good and evil: it is human (even though it's an animation). The artwork is very well done and the dubbing altogether excellent. Subtitles, in my personal opinion, would have only detracted from the nearly flawless beauty of this film. It is truely a great epic in an era of short attention spans and quick fixes. A story among muddles of pointless words.","As someone who has seen a plenty of videos, I can safely say that this is one of the greatest of all time.

1,best anti-aging beauty product ever,"my friend who recently finished esthetician school recommended this product to me. she said that it mimics skin's natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil. i have been using it on my face at night for about four months now and i swear there is a dramatic difference. my skin looks smoother and plumper and my wrinkles are far less noticeable. i have always been quite skeptical of beauty products that claim to ""turn back the clock,"" but this one really does. I have never been so sold on something in my entire life. mark my word, once more people catch on to this stuff it's going to be the next miracle treatment. IT REALLY WORKS, and, oh yeah, it's way cheaper than all those potions you can buy at the Macy's cosmetic counter that don't really do much more than Pond's.","my friend who recently finished esthetician school recommended this product to me. she said that it mimics skin's natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil. i have been using it on my face at night for about four months now and i swear there is a dramatic difference. my skin looks smoother and plumper and my wrinkles are far less noticeable. i have always been quite skeptical of beauty products that claim to turn back the clock, but this one really does.

0,This One Totally Misfired,"I tend to agree with those that think American Beauty was a better film, but unlike most, I found Revolutionary Road horribly miscast, especially Kate Winslet. Of course her husband having directed the film has nothing to do with it. The subject matter I always find fascinating and Mendes does a decent enough job. For me, the masterpiece for which all others are judged will always be Burt Lancaster's The Swimmer.The Swimmer [Region 2]If we're lucky, HBO might consider a series based on the short stories by John Cheever, and while we're at it, the short stories of J.G. Ballard. Good timing with all the angst the middle class is going through now.","I tend to agree with those that think American Beauty was a better film, but unlike most, I found Revolutionary Road horribly miscast, especially Kate Winslet.

1,"Portions are somewhat cheesy, but overall entertaining and informative","I enjoyed The Human Face - it's an interesting examination of how facial features have evolved, how one's face is interpreted by others, and tackles some elusive topics such as defining beauty. It's not a dry documentary, but rather a collection of ""factoids"" strung together in a generally entertaining and informative fashion.The skits are an major component of each episode and, for the most part, if you're a Cleese fan you'll enjoy them. A few dragged on a bit too long - I would have preferred a bit more information than entertainment in the mix. But overall, an enjoyable way to walk away with some interesting information on the human face.","I enjoyed The Human Face - it's an interesting examination of how facial features have evolved, how one's face is interpreted by others, and tackles some elusive topics such as defining beauty.

0,An insult to intelligence!,"This book is not all bad. There are brief passages that are even remotely original.

1,Easier to follow than the cast album,"I liked this musical very much! I remember watching the Tony Awards the year that the original production won the Award for Best Musical over ""Beauty and the Beast""--the more likely contender for the top prize; and I thought it was a mistake until I had seen the original cast program. I had only heard the cast album of ""Beauty"" and once I saw ""Passion"" I saw ""Beauty"" as an overblown, juvenile production for the kiddies and I don't see how it could have been nominated. I think that Jere Shea is very good-looking gentleman with a good voice as Georgio, Marin Mazzie is a beauty of an actress as Clara and then there is Donna Murphy in her Tony Award-winning performance as Fosca, the unattractive yet passionate older woman reaching out desperately for Georgio's love. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Sondheim--the Broadway genius who wrote the score.","I liked this musical very much!

1,Better and glorious on stage,"I have had the CD to ""Passion"" for a while now. I had only listened to it once. Out of all the Sondheim cast recordings that I have (I have 12) this one just didn't appeal to me as much as ""Follies"" or ""Company."" But yesterday I bought the video and though the music is definetly in my opinion hard to listen to on CD comes to life when it is put together with visions of beauty and grace. ""Passion"" does deserve to be joined in the ranks of the other great Sondheim shows. And I was a fool to bench it without giving it a chance. Performances are extraordinary and staging is incredible. Now if only ""Follies"" was available on video also.",I have had the CD to Passion for a while now. I had only listened to it once.

1,I love reading the end of this book!,This book gives tremendous detail historically and Biblically of events leading up to the battle of the title. My favorite part is in the last three chapters which tell the positive events that follow the conflicts. Specifically I am impressed by the beauty of God's plan of restitution promised by all of God's prophets. The harmony of the scriptures paint a beautiful picture of man's future.

1,Amazing Game...too easy,"This is a truly amazing game. Its graphics are far better than either Myst or Riven. Worth buying just for the beauty of the graphics and the sound.

1,Evan Rachel Wood,"This certainly doesn't rank among Allen's best films. It has its embarrassing dead spots, but it also has its very amusing moments, many of which are supplied by the arrivals, separately and separated, of Melodie's parents from Mississippi, and the bizarre surprizes they encounter in NYC. Slim stuff, perhaps, but funny. The thrill of this film is the pleasure of watching Evan Rachel Wood emerge from a misfit runaway into the enchanting beauty she becomes as the film progresses. A casting coup for Allen and a delight for his audience.If you want to see her looking just as great in a very fine film that isn't funny at all, see ""Down in the Valley"", with Edward Norton.","This certainly doesn't rank among Allen's best films.

1,"Eyes Wide Shut: Intimate, Beautiful, Unforgettable","There are so many things I love about this film, I hardly know where to begin! Obviously Kubrick put a GREAT deal of love into every aspect of the film; into every moment. Each scene lives in my memory indelibly; more vividly than most of my own experiences save dreams bordering on visions. I don't know how to respond to other reviewers' comments/difficulties concerning the plot. Perhaps it is far-fetched? I admit that watching this film is an extra-ordinary experience. (Wasn't 2001 meant to be this way as well?) Nevertheless, I do feel that the story relates to our lives in a very real and helpful way. I felt the capacity for un-conditional love affirmed in a most satisfying way, in the midst of overwhelming temptation. Also, the importance of sex ought not to be underestimated in a marriage relationship. This movie sincerely and most completely portrays the emotional intricacy and beauty of this deeply personal subject.","There are so many things I love about this film, I hardly know where to begin!

It maps the countours of Jim's narrow life far more than it explores the world which tries to see.

0,Horrible unless you fit the stereotypes.,"I tried playing this with my girlfriend. Neither of us knows anything about sports, fishing, makeup, or fasion. Each card has three questions on it. You get to pick the one you think will stump your opponent. As almost every card had a question about one of the four above topics. We never moved anywhere. When we finally struggled our way to the wildcard line, we kept getting sent back to the start. We even tried switching decks so that we were each trying to answer questions geared supposedly towards our sex. We fared no better. It maybe better with a group of people, but we so fed up that with it that we weren't about to find out. Maybe some people who shop at the Salvation Army will have better luck.","I tried playing this with my girlfriend. Neither of us knows anything about sports, fishing, makeup, or fasion.

0,Mr. Bloom is sadly pessimistic about the future of America.,"As a teacher and lover of History, and Social Science I do understand the importance and beauty of freedom of press, mind and opinion. Mr. Bloom shows the reader the ugly side of this in this mass of pessimism. If he has intended it to motivate America's youth, he has failed. If he intended it for the reader to enjoy, he failed. In my opinion, and that of many of my colleagues, Allan Bloom is a bitter, hate filled man, with nothing better to do than write a biography of America's downfalls, ignoring all of the advantages that coincide. Shame on you Allan Bloom!","As a teacher and lover of History, and Social Science I do understand the importance and beauty of freedom of press, mind and opinion.

0,"Great potential, great disappointment.","This book should be applauded for pointing out things about today's media and culture that many people overlook. It provides a pretty good well of facts about women in the media to draw upon. Having said that, the level of analysis taken in this book is disappointingly superficial, and appears to be motivated more by shock and awe than honesty. Main fails to make several important disctinctions (in my opinion), and I fear that this book may perpetuate its own set of misconceptions about health and beauty that are no less dangerous than those perpetuated by the culture it exposes.","This book should be applauded for pointing out things about today's media and culture that many people overlook.

1,Neat Story With Subtle Message About Appreciation,"A fine book for 3-7 year-olds about a small boy Timothy, who wanted to give his mother a special birthday present.

Cameo appearances by Morgan Fairchild, as a zany ex-mime, and Mia Farrow as a syphiletic parapalegic exotic dancer.

This movie should never have start production. It is geared too much toward little kids, but I doubt even little kids would be amused by it.

It looks a lot less inviting, and they really screwed up all the beauty that Fantasia possessed in the first two movies. They turn the Childlike Empress into a joke, who even contemplates using the Auryn to go shopping! Michael Ende would die of shame if he were still alive.

1,Terrific doesn't do justice,"I first read this book in 8th grade and immediately fell in love with it. Although I own all the books in the series, Ender's Game is by far my favorite. The beauty of the book is that it is not depended upon the sci-fi aspect. While the futuristic setting does make things interesting, it's only dressing for the real story: that of a boy growing up in a demanding environment. Card does an excellent job of portraying Ender's development as the story progresses. It is nearly impossible *not* to identify with Ender.

There was sort of a terrible beauty to the way that the characters lives interacted, with one tragedy creating a series of others. It was also engrossing. I read until sunrise more than once. Mostly because I just wanted to get it over with. I wasn't looking for some sort of a fairy tale ending, but you do come to care about what happens to these characters, especially the kids, and some sort of resolution and/or growth may have stemmed my frustration with this long and very sad book.Another reviewer said it well: Only read this book if you have too much happiness in your life.

1,Look beyond the boring cover....as there's way more inside,"If you like Donnie Darko and Jena Malone you can give this a shot. Both movies refer partly to comics, both have the shining beauty of Jena Malone (please Jena, call me if you read this), and both dare to stap out of the ordinary. Most importantly, the movie is not childish as you would expect from the cover. I love the Mcfarlane art in it, and the story deals with alot of different aspects of life. In fact, you can watch it several times and you will realize this is way MORE than a stupid teen movie. In the end, it has some hidden poetry too (William Blake). It's nice to think of the concept behind this movie, as there are alot different contexts to recognize.

The story is too advanced and detailed to hold my daughter's interest, even though she loves the story of Black Beauty. The pictures are smaller and more intricate than I'd like, most covering just portions of pages rather than full pages (although there are some full-page pictures), but she still enjoys coloring them. Since she loves the story, she was very excited to have the book; though it's slightly frustrating for her sometimes, she brings it out often and keeps trying - at least she'll have it for years to come!","I bought this book for my almost 5-year old coloring fanatic, based on Amazon's age-rating of 4-8, but I'd rate it more appropriate for at least 5 or 6 year olds.

1,Bernard Herrmann's Best Music Score,"For those of us who have enjoyed the original movie ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" the music score brings a special element of beauty to the production. Bernard Herrmann's music from the original sound track flows with graceful majesty and can whisk you away from where you are to a distant seacoast where fog and mist abound.The CD I received was of high quality and my favorite activity with the album was to drive a mile to my own seacoast, Long Island Sound, and watch the waves from a Nor' Easter rolling to the beach while listening to the score. Not a bad way to spend an hour!","For those of us who have enjoyed the original movie The Ghost and Mrs. Muir the music score brings a special element of beauty to the production.

1,Amazing.,"There are no words that can explain how I felt after seeing this film. Everything about it is perfect, every minute if the film is perfect. Nothing possibly could make it better. It was as if I had just seen a sunset for the first time. I was amazed by the beauty, the emotion, the wonder, the love that this movie portrayed. Even now I can't think of the right words to express how I feel about the movie. I feel every word I type is not at all expressing what I want to say. I would also like to praise Goran Bregovic for his work on the soundtrack. I have been a fan of his for some years and I'm sad to see that he is so underated.

LOL So since this author is so HOLY, did she give all of her profits to charities or did she pamper herself? Do not buy this book if you want to stay sane.

1,This is what Skinnee is all about.,"This album is absolutely unbelievable. The lyrics are incredibly well-crafted, it is a thing of beauty for sure. The only song for the J's that even earned them remote popularity is Riot Nrrrd, which really could serve as the anthem for the CD and the band if The Good, The Bad, and The Skinnee wasn't there to put all other songs in their place. There is simply not a bad song on this CD. Buy it, listen to it, look up the lyrics in Webster's, then know why they are the best lyricists on the planet.","This album is absolutely unbelievable.

1,I would recommend this coffee maker,"This is the second Black and Decker Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker we have owned. The first had a glass liner in the carafe. The current carafe is insulated metal. There is only a slight difference in the length of time the coffee stays hot. Our coffee is hot all morning and by early to mid-afternoon is starting to cool a little. The beauty of a thermal carafe is that the coffee doesn't sit and ""cook"" on the burner all day making it taste bitter and ""old"".I like this coffee maker and would recommend it to anyone. With all thermal carafes, the pot is smaller than a regular coffee maker carafe and one must take that into consideration when deciding on a thermal carafe. The quality is great and the timer feature is fantastic when we want to have our coffee ready for us when we get up in the morning.","This is the second Black and Decker Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker we have owned.

0,Not worth the money..,"I received this mirror for Christmas, and I was terribly disappointed in it.First, the ""touch"" sensor aspect of it is just poor design: if you attempt to readjust the angle of the mirror while applying makeup, surprise, the light changes or goes out.Second, I found both mirrors to be blurry no matter what I did with them. I initially thought they were covered in plastic or maybe coated for protection in shipment, but they were just poorly made.Third, and this was really the clincher, no matter which of the settings you choose, the lights are never really bright enough to simulate ANY kind of environment, let alone assist you in applying makeup.In closing, it's not worth the money. I tried to use it twice and returned it - I do much better using regular overhead lighting and standing super close to a regular mirror than I did struggling to use this.","I received this mirror for Christmas, and I was terribly disappointed in it.First, the touch sensor aspect of it is just poor design if you attempt to readjust the angle of the mirror while applying makeup, surprise, the light changes or goes out.Second, I found both mirrors to be blurry no matter what I did with them.

1,A Lot of Fun,"Finally, a second album from a promising songsmith that isn't the pits! An actual improvement IMHO over her first.

0,disappointing,"I'd heard much about this 1976 series and purchased it because of the glowing reviews on Amazon.com. In fact, it isn't very good. The TV budget was obviously minimal, and the acting is soap opera quality (everyone seems to shout, as if on stage, and at times you can almost read the script). As for the history, well, a great deal is left out, and one can imagine most people being quite confused. The makeup is the outstanding feature of the series (although the line of the lead's bald spot is sometimes visible), which says too much about this lengthy series. It's wiser to invest the time in McColloch's biography.","I'd heard much about this 1976 series and purchased it because of the glowing reviews on Amazon.com. In fact, it isn't very good.

1,Guaranteed to raise the hairs on your skin,"It's a Soft Boys album, but it sounds like the evolution of Robyn Hitchcock to me. He's been quoted as saying ""when I make a record with a band, it turns out to be a Beatles record"". I'd agree with that, but Beatles at their jammingest.The twin lead guitar interplay between Robyn and Kimberly Rew is nothing short of breathtaking. The lyrics are signature Robyn Hitchcock surreal, but at one point, he eerily captures the strange and scary times we live in: ""Evil is the new enemy / I wish I could say that I was just paranoid"" (from ""Strings"").The beauty of this CD is that Hitchcock and his band gracefully manages to walk the thin line between melodic pop and total, over the edge, into the abyss guitar freakout.All in all, an excellent album, which will definitely stand the test of time.","It's a Soft Boys album, but it sounds like the evolution of Robyn Hitchcock to me.

0,Horrible colors!,"I grew up on this movie, and frequently still watch the original VHS that I have kept from my childhood. The colors in this new one are not only much more vivid (as expected) but have been transformed into bright pink and green all over the background of the film. They even went as far as changing the color of Belle's eyes. She was one of the the few princess figures from traditional Disney who had brown hair and brown eyes, but now she has hazel eyes. It is a small thing, but part of what made the film so great was the mundane beauty of Belle. Disney transformed the original film into something aimed even more so at little girls and has reinforced the culturally false ideals that beauty cannot be mundane. Way to go Disney.","I grew up on this movie, and frequently still watch the original VHS that I have kept from my childhood.

0,A Mediocre Beauty,"This is not a production for the ages but for the Royal Ballet, perhaps. Instead, check out the two best Sleeping Beauties--the 2006 Paris Opera Ballet DVD and the 2001 Kirov Ballet DVD (with Larissa Lezhnina as Aurora). The dancing and production values of the French and Russian versions are superlative in all respects. The choreography of this English version is abridged, slow, dignified, not well executed and, well, boring, with several dancers plain embarrassing (eg, the Bluebird duet). To see what the Royal Ballet used to be capable of, check out the Evening with the Royal Ballet DVD, which features ACT III of Sleeping Beauty with Margot Fonteyn from 1962. At age 40, Dame Margot was an order of magnitude better than a twenty-something Cojocaru.","This is not a production for the ages but for the Royal Ballet, perhaps.

0,Doesn't work for long time black dye users,"I purchased this at a local beauty supply and was told by the store employee's that it works great.

I followed the directions to the T and was left with the same black color. My hair is not the slightest bit lighter, and I was left with rotten egg/sulfur scented hair after ten washes!!!May work on fresh dye jobs but I wouldn't know.","I purchased this at a local beauty supply and was told by the store employee's that it works great.

I finished the Wallflower series, 2nd best for me is Evie vs Sebastian St. Vincent in Devil in the Winter.However Lilian shall be my favorite Sassy Heroine forever. Her interaction with Lord Westcliff is most witty. I like them more in this 1st series. Daisy still Ok, but not too wonderful.I love your historical Ms. Kleypas. My favorite others authors so far are Sabrina Jeffries (Beware of Scott's revenge), Nicole Jordan (To Bed a Beauty), & Judith Mcnaught (A Kingdom of Dreams).

1,Cute and entertaining,"I rented this movie on a snowy day along with several other films and was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something light and fun and that is exactly what I got.Jason Biggs, who played the charming but goofy lead in American Pie, is Paul a guy who moves from the mid-west to New York City to go to College and is immeadiately overwhelmed by ""city"" life. His roomates are horrible and only add to his inability to fit in.In class Paul meets Dora, Mena Suvari - who was also in American Pie as well as American Beauty. As Paul gets to know Dora he begins to see that life in the big city is not all bad. Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear were all good in this movie - the plot was not as strong as most of Amy Heckerling's past high school type comedy's such as Fast Time or Clueless but this film was still cute.Loser would make a cute date film or would be good when you are looking for something light.","I rented this movie on a snowy day along with several other films and was pleasantly surprised.

1,An Excellent Introduction,"Walter Benjamin has progressed over the years from an obscure lesser member of the Frankfurt School to a widely read leading member of that obscure school. Aided by such as Hannah Arendt, who introduced him to a wider audience in her writings (and also to me), readers have come to appreciate Benjamin for the beauty of his writing as well as his sharp insight.This volume, along with its companion, is an excellent introduction to the style and thought of this man who, while out of step with his times, possessed the insight to give those times an original critique.Possessed of a lively style and free from the Marxist bagge that weighs down his Frankfurt School colleagues such as Adorno and Horkheimer (I think Benjamin owes much more to Heidegger than Marx), Benjamin will hook any reader who takes the time to spend an hour or two with this book. From here it's an easy step to purchase other Benjamin writings, a step I can almost guarantee.","Walter Benjamin has progressed over the years from an obscure lesser member of the Frankfurt School to a widely read leading member of that obscure school.

1,"Beautiful, but not perfect.","I read a few of the reviews for this book and I feel compelled to do a review of my own, because, I am sorry to say, they totally misrepresented it.In a culture where girls are brought up to be sold in marriage and their individuality and freedom is often repressed, Shabanu has a spirit that cannot be quenched by the stick striking across her ribs, or the rules of tradition followed by countless generations of women. Her elder sister, Phulan, is beautiful, but ""beauty is only skin deep"", especially in her case.This is the first book I've read from the point of view of a Muslim girl, and it's really opened my eyes about how life can be for them.

Performances are solid, but Sverák's intimate direction works against the film's epic sweep, and the result is neither one thing or another. Hádek looks like a Bel Ami porn beauty, which is a huge plus, and Charles Dance makes a brief appearance in the role of a pompous RAF commander.","DARK BLUE WORLDTmavomodr SvetCzech RepublicUKGermanyDenmarkItaly - 2001Aspect ratio 2.391 Hawk ScopeTheatrical soundtrack Dolby Digital Surround EX1939 Two Czech fighter pilots Ondrej Vetch and Krystof Hdek flee the Nazi occupation of their homeland and travel to England, where they join the RAF and are torn apart by their mutual love of a lonely young woman Tara Fitzgerald.Despite its ravishing widescreen visuals and glorious aerial combat sequences, Jan Sverk's wartime melodrama is a little too restrained for its own good, even when the two main characters become divided by Vetch's unethical behavior.

1,Beautiful,"Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"" is for sure the most incredible motion picture of the year. Wonderfully directed by the acclaimed Sam Mendes (Academy Award Winner-Best Director-American Beauty). Don't let that scare you though! This film has no sexual nature to it at all. The R rating is due to pervasive disturbing violent content, and profanity is scarce. Tom Hanks gives the opposite performance than usual, as a killer and bankrobber. Jude Law and Paul Newman gave exceptional performances as well. The feature length was about 2 hours long, and certainly was not an action-packed, special effects thriller, rather a slower moving, yet still very interesting piece of art. Tom Hanks, who usually takes on very emotional characters, gave a rather unemotional performance, but there was a very subtle hint of the normal Hanks. As my closing comment, every aspect of this movie was perfect, and I can't wait until Feb. 25 to purchase the dvd.","Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition is for sure the most incredible motion picture of the year.

1,Stunning choral works and performances!,"The beauty and purity of the music and sound here cannot be overstated. How does one describe the effect of a hundred voice choir singing? I don't have the words. The works here are by mostly contemporary composers whose roots go back centuries. The title work is the only piece that has a sparse but beautiful horn accompaniment. The Seattle Choral Compnay and its director, Fred Coleman, are to be warmly applauded. Marvelous. Highly, highly recommended!","The beauty and purity of the music and sound here cannot be overstated.

There is room on DVDs for both, but the creator of this DVD is not very sophisticated in the art of film making."
1,An achingly beautiful tribute to a lost friend,"This book took my breath away with the beauty of its lyricism and metaphors. Many writers attempting to tie a traumatic event in with their own lives fail to do so with total clarity - Imbrie is not guilty of this flaw! The violent loss of a friend and its implications to the author's own life are brilliantly set forth by this author. As a former student of Imbrie's I can attest to the sincerity of this book as well as to her innate gift with words. Women whose lives have been touched by violence will especially appreciate this book, a real work of literary art as well as a beautiful tribute to a lost (stolen!) friend.","This book took my breath away with the beauty of its lyricism and metaphors.

0,Most underachieving Holiday music collection of all time?,"The original Vince Guaraldi Trio 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' is one of the the all-time classics for both jazz fans and lovers of Holiday music. As such, any attempt to re-do the work in its entirety-even by the best talent in the Jazz world- will struggle to reach that high bar. Trumpeter Rick Braun's version of 'My Little Drum' by sounds really nice, and Dave Koz's sax refreshes 'Linus and Lucy' well enough, but it seems like most of the other artists just showed up for the paycheck. The result is a mixed bag, and being as each track features a different jazz artist, there isn't even any real pattern throughout. Chaka Khan's rendition of 'The Christmas Song ' may be the worst ever recorded. Jazz snobs may get it, those particular to the simple beauty and unique flow of the original may not.","The original Vince Guaraldi Trio 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' is one of the the all-time classics for both jazz fans and lovers of Holiday music.

1,"If you want a vinage coif, this book is for you","I ran across this book for the first time on eBay, and my curiosity was piqued. It's essentially a mid-1960s guide to styling your hair. It explains what types of rollers you need and how to set them to create the 1960s' most popular hair styles. There are many illustrations as well as a 16 page section of photographs detailing how to set, brush out and create popular hair styles of the era. If retro beauty is your thing, it's definitely worth the money.","I ran across this book for the first time on eBay, and my curiosity was piqued.

1,Alive and Kicking,"What a RELIEF to find our boys have emerged from their fascination with pop culture and chintzy production with their inspirational musicality and soulfulness intact. And on ""All That You Can't Leave Behind,"" they feel another day warmer and wiser. Here's a band that for 20 years has taken upon itself to shoulder the moral obligations of rock and searched through its music for justice, meaning and satisfaction. And its grand opening statement here is ""It's a beautiful day--don't let it slip away!"" One is tempted to think that they found what they were looking for--an ease with the world and the ability to recognize beauty in every moment. The rest of the album carries this same sunny and unaffected vibe.

1,A little bottle of Keratin Gold,"I did not read any of the reviews about this product before I bought it because I am already an avid user of the brand. But I wish I had read some of the reviews on it before I used it because I was not happy about having to leave the product in for 48 hours. It did make my hair feel greasy and dirty. With that said, I will absolutely be using this product again and again. I did not even wait the full 48 hours because I just couldn't stand the feeling and immediately I felt a difference in my hair nourishment and softness. My hair is now much easier to manage and feels great. I am a serial hair colorer and my hair is far beyond damaged. But, after using this product it feels as if year and years of hair damage has been removed and my dry, damaged hair is now silky and touchable locks of shiny beauty. I would recommend this product to everyone.","I did not read any of the reviews about this product before I bought it because I am already an avid user of the brand.

1,Ignore the 'naysayers'!,"As a fan from the UK, I have all the live DVDs. It occurs to me that poor reviews of this production stem from people with no sense of adventure and no imagination. I absolutely love this one. I had forgotten how much until I had a Friday night with no plans and on a whim played this for the first time in a long while. It blew me away. The way it was edited for me encapsulates the essence of DMB. The beauty, the emotion and, let me go out on the edge here, the mind bending experience of a DMB concert is perfectly locked away in this creation. The visuals bring to life what to me is the essence of a DMB concert, which is living in the moment. No matter what has gone on before and what the future brings now is the time.

0,Great.... For scaring your unwanted in-laws away!,"Anyone expecting the great standards of Arthur, Merlin and the knights of the Round Table as set forth by Monmouth, De Troyes, and Malory will be in for a rude awakening. Merlin is not at all a story of honor, valor, chivalry, and dark magic. What is offered here instead is an amalgam of such fairy tales as Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella miunus decent screenplay and acting. This has got to be the worst sword and sorcery film since Red Sonja. If you aren't a purist and don't mind watching slop from time-to-time, then by all means go right on ahead.

I was very impressed with the breadth of topical advice, which is presented in a very lively and engaging manner. The authors did such a skillfull job demonstrating the relevancy and beauty of Jewish traditions and history that, raised as a Christian, I found myself becoming a tad envious of the heritage! I definitely recommend this book as a worthwhile read.","I recently purchased this book as a bat mitzvah gift for a young friend, and couldn't help reading through several chapters myself.

0,Thick book... tiny content,"I did read all these great reviews and finally decided to buy this book.To summarize - its rather disappointing.Lighting? Not so great on it. Retouching? Beauty retouching technique (yes, no plurals) is pretty much ""blur + brush"".. With some texture to throw in. Sharpening technique (yes. No plurals again) - well.. not a lot of use - could be better done with LAB space. Most of colour discussion is about RGB space. Excuse me, what happened to CMYK and Lab? Bits about calibration - yes, nice, but not a lot of details. Its almost like someone thought up an idea for book, wrote few chapters then got sick of it, and started to throw in random thoughts and ideas just to fill up space.I woulnt recommend this book to anyone who ever read Welcome To Oz! or any other decent book on photoshop.","I did read all these great reviews and finally decided to buy this book.To summarize - its rather disappointing.Lighting?

1,Toni,"Good things come in small packages! This is the best little book on natural hair care that I have ever read, and believe me I have read quite a few. Most others talk about ""healthy"" weave care and ""healthy"" perm care, and other products and processes that have no health value at all, but are, in reality, the root cause of hair breakage and other Black hair care problems. This book succintly lists hair care ingredients to avoid and those to incorporate. It explains in plain and simple language why various products are damaging to Black hair and Black health. Websites are also provided for updated information and to further the discussion on health and hair. Kudos to Mirielle! Never before has anyone de-mystified and simplified Black hair care from perspective of health and natural beauty.","Good things come in small packages!

0,ONE STAR FOR THIS POINTLESS RELEASE.....5 STARS FOR THE FILM THOUGH!!!,"No doubt ""the emperor's new groove"" is by far a great entertainer and one of the best animated films to come out of disney studios but do you actually need another edition of the dvd when two different editions are already available? One being a single disc and the other one being a 2disc collector's edition. Again another single disc release for the same film doesnt make any sense to me. Moreover they havent even cut down the price this time or improved on any bonus materials on the disc.I just dont get disney and buena vista's strange ways.

0,Bad movie,"This vile, pretentious dump of a movie sucks joy out of your life. Breillat exhibits no love for humankind. I find something to like in most movies, but Breillat has made it onto my small enemies list with this one. Not someone I want to be spending my time with. I think the last movie I hated as much as this was ""Johnny Mnemonic"". If you do watch it, make sure you have something good on hand to wash the taste out of your mouth. I'm going for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Singing in the Rain would probably be even better.For balance, I will add that there are a couple of scenes which have some human interest to them. But mostly this is a cold, cruel, inhuman flick.","This vile, pretentious dump of a movie sucks joy out of your life. Breillat exhibits no love for humankind.

0,Antiquated,"Should have looked more closely at the author before purchasing. Although it's a refreshing view of the beauty of sex and the spiritual connection it creates between you and God, it also has a very conservative sexual undercurrent. My sense was that the author would not consider a queer relationship as applicable to his theory and he also strongly advocates for abstinence before marriage, which is something that I think is antiquated.","Should have looked more closely at the author before purchasing.

0,Arrrggghh!,"With its warm, original premise and Oscar-pedigree cast, this could have been a decent ""family values"" kind of movie if it wasn't sabotaged in its dying moments by an utterly pointless surprise climax and a hideously mawkish ending. It skirts self-indulgence for 100 minutes then drives full speed over the brink. But without the emotional setup this kind of ending requires, rather than weeping you'll probably be rolling your eyes. The film runs slightly long, but thankfully the performances from Spacey, Hunt and ""that kid"" (Haley Joel Osment) are magnificent throughout, so at least there's something interesting to look at - other than your watch. On paper, this must have looked like gold: a best-selling novel, an Academy-blessed cast, and even the music from ""American Beauty"". Proof yet again that films designed to garner Oscars rarely do.","With its warm, original premise and Oscar-pedigree cast, this could have been a decent family values kind of movie if it wasn't sabotaged in its dying moments by an utterly pointless surprise climax and a hideously mawkish ending.

1,Breathtaking young talent,"Teddy Thompson's voice is stunning, not just it's natural beauty but the subtle delivery I associate with much more seasoned performers. It makes me think of George Jones and Johnny Cash and the way they could turn a song inside out. The arrangements on Separate Ways are similarly nuanced. I'm of his dad's generation, but if I were in my 20s, I'm sure I'd be playing this album non-stop. As it is, I've got it mixed into my playlists.","Teddy Thompson's voice is stunning, not just it's natural beauty but the subtle delivery I associate with much more seasoned performers.

1,The Mole,"This game is AWESOME. One thing to remember though...it IS a computer game! It is as realistic as any PC based game can be. The speed and handling is extremely realistic. The beauty of this game is that you can set all of the handling properties of your car. Everything from individual tire pressures to trackbar adjustments can be made on your car in the ""setup"" area. You can even do custom paint schemes for your car. There are some things that take getting used to. Lining up after a yellow-flag is sometimes a challenge, but easy enough to figure out. I highly recommend this game. It will provide you with hours of entertainment!!","This game is AWESOME. One thing to remember though...it IS a computer game! It is as realistic as any PC based game can be.

1,An Often missed Pre-Raphaelite Vision,"This amazing book is well worth the investment. These photos still have the power to knock one over the head with their dizzying beauty. Too often people look to the men who made up the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood for an ideal of the Victorian woman. For a fresh look, one should explore Victoriana through the eyes of the women themselves. Cameron's photography is the perfect counterpart to Christina Rosetti's poetry. Enjoy.","This amazing book is well worth the investment. These photos still have the power to knock one over the head with their dizzying beauty.

0,"Disappointing, given the internet hype","I've been using AlphaDerma-CE for about 30 days, and the results have been underwhelming. While it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, I haven't noticed any reductions in wrinkles or damage. I'm 44 years old, and I have wrinkling around my eyes and extending from the sides of my nose, mostly due to sun exposure; however, the AlphaDerma-CE dries my skin further. As a remedy, I use moisturizer on top of the AlphaDerma, but there's no information accompanying the product regarding using moisturizers and/or makeup on top of it. Does that lessen its positive effects? Should I wait X amount of time before applying other products over it? How long before I should see some improvement in my skin? Thirty days? 60? 90? So far, I'm disappointed. I can see no reduction whatsoever in wrinkling, and perhaps a small increase, due to dryness.","I've been using AlphaDerma-CE for about 30 days, and the results have been underwhelming.

1,"Good quality, not-so-compact","I ordered these brushes to pack in my overnight bag, as I travel often, and was always in fear of leaving my beloved Bobbi Brown brushes in some random hotel room. The quality is very good, and the brushes work quite well. I was a bit disappointed, however, with the size of the case; while, like the brushes, it is very well-made and aesthetically pleasing, it is a bit large (IMO) for traveling. Those who do not find space (or lack thereof) in their beauty bag an issue will likely appreciate that this brush case has ample room for a compact and perhaps other small items inside.","I ordered these brushes to pack in my overnight bag, as I travel often, and was always in fear of leaving my beloved Bobbi Brown brushes in some random hotel room.

1,"Excellent! wWnderful, easy read. Graphically accurate!","'Junky' has been criticized for lacking form, or even tact, but in that is its beauty.'Junky' does not possess the atypical story arc that we are taught in high school English class, but this mimics the junky lifestyle. There is no thought of adventure for the junky. There is no sense of purpose other than the constant search for more junk. Burroughs makes this abundantly clear without being repetative.As for the graphic descriptions, this, too, adds to its atmosphere. Junkies in reality are not phased by their constipation, sores, or disgusting habits, and the matter-of-fact tone of the narration makes that clear.This book is one of those rare and beautiful works that truly gives you a feeling for what it is like to exist in that world.","'Junky' has been criticized for lacking form, or even tact, but in that is its beauty.'Junky' does not possess the atypical story arc that we are taught in high school English class, but this mimics the junky lifestyle.

1,And now in living color.........,"Tom Bianchi has been successfully producing collections of the male nude for some time now and in most bookstores across the country they are the best sellers of any in the genre. I think there is solid reason for this. Tom celebrates the male image and does so unabashedly. While many other fine genre photographers emphasize the composition, the inner beauty, the interaction between the model and the photographer, the case for light and shadow concealing and revealing, Tom consistently goes for the joy of living, of interacting with friends, the gutsy good humor and good times of just a bunch of men frolicking in the nude. Refreshing to see. In ON THE COUCH the setting is consistent - the oft mentioned leather couch which, knowing Tom's sense of humor, is rather an homage to the infamous 'casting couch' or 'therapist's couch.' All things condisered this is a happy book, filled with beautiful men in rich color. Reading and revisiting it is a joy.","Tom Bianchi has been successfully producing collections of the male nude for some time now and in most bookstores across the country they are the best sellers of any in the genre.

1,Ying and Yang perfection,"Colins Higgin's simple premise and Hal Ashby's subtle direction, coupled with on-target performances illuminates the brilliant use of irony that is lacking in cinema today. This perfect ying and yang; a young man who has everything,status,wealth and youth is obsessed with death. Contrast him with a woman in her twilight, faded beauty, no visible means of support, living on the fringe but she is obsessed with life. If comedy is derived from conflict then there is plenty of it in this film. I can't urge you enough to watch this movie. It inspires me and makes me laugh.PS, also look for the visual metaphors, like ""Perma Seal"" on the coffin or the daisies to tombstones sequence. Powerful stuff!","Colins Higgin's simple premise and Hal Ashby's subtle direction, coupled with on-target performances illuminates the brilliant use of irony that is lacking in cinema today.

1,Beautiful Biotin,"The product description was accurate; I was very pleased with the purchase and fast delivery. This item was very difficult to find and Amazon had the liquid biotin extract at a reasonable price. I was expecting to pay much more considering the difficulty in locating the product at popular internet beauty supply or health food outlets. Amazon's search was easy and offered multitudes of options. I'm using this product as part of my hair and nail growth formula. Hopefully, if the claims are valid, I will have strong Rapunzel-like hair, long eyelashes, thicker brows, healthy nails and smoother skin. People think I look young now, I hope to keep them guessing.","The product description was accurate I was very pleased with the purchase and fast delivery.

1,Nice hat,"In my quest to find a denim cowboy hat, I came across this little beauty. While not quite perfect, this is a nice hat.

1,Excellent Deck,"I love the Celtic Wisdom Tarot deck - the images are illustrated in gorgeous, saturated colors and each card is fully explained in the book that comes with the deck. I have found the readings I have done with this deck very helpful - they get right to the heart of the matter. I have probably purchased two to three dozen divinatory decks over the last ten years or so, and this one really stands out both for the intense beauty of the images, and the clear and helpful way the book is written to help you determine the meanings of each card and reading that you do. I highly recommend this deck.","I love the Celtic Wisdom Tarot deck - the images are illustrated in gorgeous, saturated colors and each card is fully explained in the book that comes with the deck.

1,A new generation of horror,"Although this film is not yet available from Amazon, I had the pleasure of viewing it this past friday at the Horrorhound Weekend in Indianapolis, Indiana. I had an amazing opportunity to meet both Bart Mastronardi, the film's writer/director, and Alan Kelly Rowe, who plays Urbane in the film. As a fan of all the great classic horror classics, it was refreshing to see a film that strayed from the basic formula. This film was a psychological rollercoaster from start to end. CAUTION: not for the faint of heart!What sold me on giving this film a chance was that the master of horror, Clive barker, endorced it by saying:""Vindication, the film, is a total vindication for movie-making the old-fashioned way. It's made with brains, beauty and balls, giving audiences sick of gutless studio rip-offs a taste of what a real horror movie looks and feels like.""","Although this film is not yet available from Amazon, I had the pleasure of viewing it this past friday at the Horrorhound Weekend in Indianapolis, Indiana.

I was also pleased that the band was very large and not tight on the wrist. The only thing I do not like but it is minor is that there is a small magnifying bubble on glass part of the face. I know this is to help you see the date, but I feel it stands out and takes away from the beauty of the black face of the watch. I did not realize the watch had this from the pictures on Amazon but again, it is a minor issue.

1,HERE'S ONE THAT REALLY GRABS ME,"I've been more or less a casual fan of Costello over the years.Some of his work moves me and some does not. ""All This Useless Beauty"" is one that truly does. He's always written incredible lyrics. I remember catching him on Letterman when this came out. He did ""It's Time"" as a solo acoustic piece and completely blew me away. That song in my mind is so definitive of his dark lyricism and there's plenty of other great stuff here as well. ""The Other End Of The Telescope"", ""Complcated Shaddows"" and ""Poor Fractured Atlas"" are essential Costello in my book. His best work since ""Spike""... Costello has been so prolific over the years. He doesn't always hit the nail on the head, but he certainly did so here.","I've been more or less a casual fan of Costello over the years.Some of his work moves me and some does not.

The two sisters are opposite in terms of one being practical and the other who bases her actions only upon emotions. They both learn through the trials and tribulations of their time how to balance logic and feelings to overcome the odds and fall in love. It was just so heartwarming and I can't say enough about the acting, every little look meant something, every action had meaning. The sets were gorgeous, you could just feel the wind blowing and the beauty all around you when you watched the film. The whole movie was a perfect 5. I don't rate many at this number, so be prepared for a good time well spent. Warning, it may appeal more to the female sex, but men could learn a thing or two from watching this comedy/drama.","This movie is just wonderful! I love the acting of Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.

1,This is the best one out there!,"I agree that this is the best eye makeup remover there is. I worked in a department store as the cosmetic manager and have tried them all. I have the MOST sensitive eyes. A lot of removers irritate my eyes to the point that they would crack and bleed. This is the only remover I can use. It not only doesn't irritate my eyes at all, but actually soothes them and hydrates them slightly. I can't say enough great things about this product. Wish it didn't cost so much, but it IS worth the money","I agree that this is the best eye makeup remover there is. I worked in a department store as the cosmetic manager and have tried them all.

1,A wonderful rendition of Debussy's operettas,"This is the only known recording of Debussy's ""L'enant Prodigue"" (Prodigal Son), and it is superbly rendered with excellent orchestration and vocals. The orchestral preludes to the two operettas, especially ""L'enfant Prodigue"", are beautiful. My only complaint is that there are only two tracks on the CD, one for each operetta. However, given their beauty, one is not tempted to skip around, but rather relax and listen to the CD in its entirety.","This is the only known recording of Debussy's L'enant Prodigue Prodigal Son, and it is superbly rendered with excellent orchestration and vocals.

1,Cinematic genius in the palm of your hand,"American Beauty is an absolute must-read for any fan of film or screenwriting. Alan Ball has crafted what can easily be called a picture-perfect example of what a script should be. Ball dares to give each character time to themselves, where we see them intimately and vulnerable: Carolyn in the house she's showing, Lester stripping down in the garage, Jane at the mirror critiquing her body. In this manner we are able to instantly define their struggles, and what makes them tick. The story develops naturally and comfortably. Not once is any scene or momemt neither predictable nor unrealistic. Most often with screenplays there is something lacking--usually the added visual elements that demonstrate the script. With American Beauty it reads clearly on its own; the genius of the director, actors, cinematographers, costumers etc. merely elaborated on the prevalent themes. American Beauty is my favorite film and screenplay of all time. It is pure cinematic genius.","American Beauty is an absolute must-read for any fan of film or screenwriting.

0,NOTHING like Tolkien,"I had read that the author was the American Tolkien, so I bought the audio book, looking forward to becoming immersed in another world. This comparison couldn't be further from the truth. Tolkien's writing captures the wonder, magic, and beauty of people and the world. Tolkien's descriptive prose fills your minds with images; his people and the world are multifaceted. In Martin's book, people are concerned with one thing: power over each other. There's nothing but mean people being mean to each other and teaching the naive how to be mean. The only magic is dark; there is no wonder; there is no careful description of the world or people to draw you into its reality.Bottom line: if you're thinking about this book because you're a Tolkien fan, skip it.","I had read that the author was the American Tolkien, so I bought the audio book, looking forward to becoming immersed in another world.

0,Not impressive,"I was eager to read this book, but unfortunately, I found it to be mostly an elaboration of Sheeehy's Vanity Fair article and a lot of nasty, mean spirited gossip about the Clinton's from unnamed sources. Sheehy seems to think a girl or young woman who is more interested in her grades than in clothes and makeup is disturbed in some way and she even includes several nasty remarks about Mrs. Clinton's weight, of all things,( of course made by unnamed people.) This does not meet any kind of standard of intelligent journalism. Sheehy also makes many obvious factual errors and her prose is, to say the least, overwrought.","I was eager to read this book, but unfortunately, I found it to be mostly an elaboration of Sheeehy's Vanity Fair article and a lot of nasty, mean spirited gossip about the Clinton's from unnamed sources.

1,Excellent Series on the Origins of Mankind,"The BBC's ""Walking With Cavemen"" is a fantastic documentary series that recreates the evolutionary adventure that was the journey from our earliest hominid ancestors to modern humans of today. Using the latest research in the fields of antropology and evolutionary science, the series highlights several key steps along the way from the diminuative ape-like Australopithecus afarensis to, ultimately, Homo Sapiens Sapiens, showing the various stages of physical as well as intellectual advancements. The effects and makeup are well done and help to create an interesting and believable world where our earliest human relatives lived, hunted, fought, and died.I was very pleased with this series and would highly recommend it and the other ""Walking With..."" films to anyone interested in ancient life and anyone who wants to get a fascinating glimpse of what life might have been like for our ancestors over the course of 3 million years.","The BBC's Walking With Cavemen is a fantastic documentary series that recreates the evolutionary adventure that was the journey from our earliest hominid ancestors to modern humans of today.

1,Gorgeous tribute to a Kansas teacher and artist...,"He would have wanted to be remembered most as a teacher and friend; he was that and more to those that were fortunate enough to have known him. Such was the life of the great Swedish artist Birger Sandzen.In a glowing tribute to the man and his work, Emory Lindquist has managed to capture the essence of who he was and what he has meant to Kansas art. An absolutely beautiful account of his art and influence. Sandzen was a one of a kind visionary of the beauty that surrounds us in everyday life and nature. A first rate work by a learned historian, and obvious devotee, of Sandzen.","He would have wanted to be remembered most as a teacher and friend he was that and more to those that were fortunate enough to have known him.

0,Disappointing and Cheap,"Probably the best thing about this set is the tin metal case. The clasp on the watch broke before my daughter could get a chance to wear it. The face on the watch is pretty small, so a bit of a strain to tell time. I didn't realize that actual makeup was included with the play cell phone - recommended for children over 8; my daughter is 5, so this obvious created some parental control issues that I wish I hadn't needed to get in to in the first place. All in all a pretty cheap set that I wish I hadn't bought.","Probably the best thing about this set is the tin metal case.

0,The Perspiring Plain,"World War II is soon to end. We're in hot and humid Burma where you can count on one hand the number of scenes in which people aren't perspiring or wearing sweaty clothes. This becomes noticeable because the characters and narrative, in their cliched predictability, don't hold your attention. Brenda de Banzie has a lively turn as a Scots missionary, and Gregory Peck is convincing as a daredevil flyer who connects with an educated beauty improbably helping out in a jungle village. There's no doubt whatsoever which men in a plane crash will survive the long trek back to base. You have seen this movie many times before. You might possibly enjoy seeing it again.","World War II is soon to end.

0,Don't get the kit!,"I noticed all the reviews on this kit complained about the wax. Well it is no wonder this wax doesn't work with the muslin strips. For a cream wax you should use cloth strips not muslin. Muslin strips work best for honee waxes. This kit is expensive and doesn't give you what you want. Get the warmer by itself. I went to a beauty supply store and I got the warmer, free honee wax, 100 free muslin strips, for 25 bucks. I got it at Sally's beauty supply store during their month of June sale. Don't get the wax off btw it doesn't work nearly as well as baby oil. Rubbing alcohol works for getting it off other surfaces. Make sure you get more collars!","I noticed all the reviews on this kit complained about the wax. Well it is no wonder this wax doesn't work with the muslin strips.

0,Terribly Derivative,"I wonder what was going through BT's head when he made this horrible album. His first two albums IMA and ESCM were classics but Movement in Still Life is just the worst techno albums I have heard this year and as well as one of the worst albums in general this year. I get the impression on this cd that Brian was attempting to make that big breakthrough like Moby did with Play. Although Movement in Still Life is different to Play, the album lacks any charm and beauty and comes off rather derivative. The only songs I like on this cd is Mercury and Solace and Dreaming which is why I gave this cd two stars instead of one.","I wonder what was going through BT's head when he made this horrible album.

0,I'm so disappointed....,"It's probably unfair of me to criticize a movie nearly thirty years after it was made, but I only just now saw it for the first time and I'm sorely disappointed. I guess I'm one of these people who likes the remakes more than the origianls. I found that the acting stinks, the action is corny, and the special effects seemed bad even for 1978. The caracters seem to be living in this mall for a few weeks, and I felt like I was watching the film for a few weeks. It just seemed to drag and drag with nothing really happening. I knew I wasn't being overly critical of the film once I saw the scene where this biker gang starts smashing pies and spraying seltzer water into the faces of the zombies. I guess I'm just spoiled by todays makeup and special effects and CGI, but I'd recommend the NEW version of Dawn before this one.","It's probably unfair of me to criticize a movie nearly thirty years after it was made, but I only just now saw it for the first time and I'm sorely disappointed.

0,I must not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie,"Judging from the huge pileup of 5-star reviews, I must not have what it takes to appreciate this film.I have no problem whatsoever with zombie movies. I've watched and enjoyed many of them. Dawn of the Dead is a horrible movie. One of the worst I have ever seen.The dialog is ludicrous. The actors are utterly unconvincing. The plot is absurd. The special effects are laughable (even for its time).The makeup was the high spot and it wasn't all that great.There were way too many shots of the dead wandering around. Cut them out, and this movie would be better (and 30 merciful minutes shorter).I am an extraordinarily patient movie consumer, but sitting through this was excruciating. There isn't a friend, enemy, or total stranger to whom I would recommend this film.","Judging from the huge pileup of 5-star reviews, I must not have what it takes to appreciate this film.I have no problem whatsoever with zombie movies.

0,There is a reason she is obscure,"If there were a fire at my house and I could save only one CD, this would be it... ONLY IF I had just one CD to begin with. Since I have more, I prioritize this at the bottom just above the AOL CD ROMs that keep coming in the mail. I was attracted to this album after hearing one of Sibbery's tracks on a compilation album called ""Voce, Women of the World"". It was enough to suspect she had talent, so I bought ""Bound by the Beauty"". After four optomistic efforts of trying to like this disk, I just can't. She does have a great voice when she isn't singing in an annoying falsetto (which is about half the time). Her lyrics are so quirkily slapped here and there that they go beyond artistic and become merely self-indulgent. Maybe she has better material on other CD's. This is something I will never know.","If there were a fire at my house and I could save only one CD, this would be it... ONLY IF I had just one CD to begin with.

1,Love it...but....,"I went into buying this fragrance, thinking it would smell cinnamon-y, as other reviews I'd read on it said it had a 'foodie' scent, or smelled like cinnamon; a fragrance I've been looking for that is strictly cinnamon.Anyhow, I was pleasantly surprised that it did NOT smell like cinnamon but it was still a delightful scent that I will continue to wear. My husband likes it to so that's a bonus. It's on my Christmas wish list so, who knows, maybe I'll get the lotion and/or body wash, if they make them...It does wear off quickly so be sure to help it's staying power by using a good moisturizer on your skin; being well-hydrated helps this process. The 1.7 oz bottle is small enough for me to tote along in my makeup bag each day so I can refresh the scent as the day goes on.","I went into buying this fragrance, thinking it would smell cinnamon-y, as other reviews I'd read on it said it had a 'foodie' scent, or smelled like cinnamon a fragrance I've been looking for that is strictly cinnamon.Anyhow, I was pleasantly surprised that it did NOT smell like cinnamon but it was still a delightful scent that I will continue to wear.

1,Possibly the best album of Squeeze's career,"Unfortunately, most of Squeeze's albums are currently unavailable, except in used CD bins and such. At least ""Play"" remains in print, even if only as an import. This 1991 LP is considered by countless Squeeze fans to be their most brilliant masterpiece, as well as one of their most underrated. While ""East Side Story"" contains such commercial classics as ""Tempted"" and ""Is That Love"", ""Play"" contains more of the band's even better, more recent work. From the beauty of ""Satisfied"", to the unbelievable chord changes in ""The House Of Love"", to the more upbeat rock sound of ""Gone To The Dogs"", this album is a classic not just in Squeeze history, but rock and roll history.","Unfortunately, most of Squeeze's albums are currently unavailable, except in used CD bins and such.

0,"Run, don't walk away from this book","This book was dreadful. I figured a book that got so many flattering blurbs from reputable reviewers couldn't be all that bad, but I was mistaken. Awful. Just awful. Aside from the passages on Definitism, which were just dull, the rest of this book is descriptions either of childhood cruelty, garish teenage fashions, girls' faces covered with zit cream and bad makeup, or hideous, numbing incest and sadomasochism. The only reason I kept reading was that the back cover suggested something surprising was going to happen at the end. Yet page after page the story line meandered along, not really headed anywhere. At no point was I surprised. Disgusted certainly, but not surprised. Two thumbs down, way down.","This book was dreadful.

1,beyond 5 stars..really!!,"This is a truly incredible album. I have given 5 stars to albums before but now I wish I hadn't cos this album is beyond 5 stars. I was painting the house at the time when I first heard it, and had to stop and listen! It blew me away; It makes you wonder how someone could create and deliver songs of such beauty and depth armed with little more than a guitar, some stunning vocals from Damien and partner Lisa, and the occasional use of strings! Its hard to single out individual tracks as the album just flows effortlessly from track #1 to the final track but Blowers Daughter,Amie and Eskimo are my faves. I cannot recommend it highly enough, but suffice to say when my son borrowed it (without telling me!) I had withdrawal symptoms. This is a truly great album and I hope it is promoted properly in the USA so as many people as possible can hear it and buy it. Damien Rice deserves to be a massive star.","This is a truly incredible album. I have given 5 stars to albums before but now I wish I hadn't cos this album is beyond 5 stars.

I prefer to see these things with my own eyes, in the water, but the BBC's Blue Planet series of documentaries is a close second. Or, a proud first, in cases where they showed me marine life I never had the chance to see myself, such as the fantastic deep sea fishes or the arctic sea life seen on these DVDs.The highlites of this series are plenty: the polar bear hunting a group of beluga whales which are trapped around a breathing hole in the ice; the aforementioned deep sea organisms; time lapse footage of tidal changes; a large marine snail eating a small one, with hermit crabs waiting for the empty shell nearby; orcas separating a gray whale calf from its mother, before killing it; and many more.Fantastic footage, quality storytelling and narrated by David Attenborough with his great voice and passion for nature. A documentary not to be missed.","As an avid scuba diver, enjoying the beauty and complexity of life is one of my life's great joys.

Brought me t'tears o'joy, it did, especially in Domine Jesu Christe! Fo'those who dinna hear tha, I then believe ye'd nae recognize the soft, sweet rustle o'angel's wings nae th'power in th'voice o'God Himself!

1,Go Back To Silent Force,"While I will admit it did disappoint me, if giving a chance this CD still rises above a lot of the other filth people are putting out these days (Evanesces to name one, even at her worse on this CD Sharon Den Adel still sings circles around Amy Lee (if you could sing in circles anyways)). The Howling was amazing a good start for the CD but then What Have You Done lays the disappointment on thick. I have noticed a lot of people don't like Frozen but personally I think it is a great song. Our Solem Hour is more reminiscent of Silent Force and all in all a good song. Heart Of Everything is also a great song and Cross is also good the rest is very medium to low quality when compared to Silent Force. Most of the time it failed to catch my attention. Still the CD grows on me so maybe one day I will love the CD but never will it surpass the greatness of Silent Force or the beauty of Mother Earth.","While I will admit it did disappoint me, if giving a chance this CD still rises above a lot of the other filth people are putting out these days Evanesces to name one, even at her worse on this CD Sharon Den Adel still sings circles around Amy Lee if you could sing in circles anyways.

1,Another Album Another Treat,"These ex-Steps members have stuck close to the Steps sound with songs like ""DJ"" and ""Half a Heart"" but have also incorporated more American-ized pop music as illustrated in ""Centre of My Heart"", ""You're a Love Song"", and ""Too Close to Tears"". Of course, they have to carry on their tradition of covering some old songs like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the title track ""Another You Another Me"" written by ABBA's Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (actually, it's not really a cover, but it was written back in 1985 and ABBA never recorded it). Some of the songs seem really generic American pop, but seeing that pop has faded from the musical scene, this album was very refreshing to listen to.","These ex-Steps members have stuck close to the Steps sound with songs like DJ and Half a Heart but have also incorporated more American-ized pop music as illustrated in Centre of My Heart, You're a Love Song, and Too Close to Tears.

0,You're better off with an extendable shoe rack you can put on the floor,"I bought two of these for my Deluxe Closet System, but returned them immediately. These take up a lot of vertical space from the system, and the system is designed to be set up at a certain heigth, so you loose space below the lowest rack.The closet we configured allowed us to have a separate, longer shoe rack put on the floor, with two racks. We have 12 shoe pairs below the closet.Alas, since it all depends on the configuration of your closet, you might find them useful. The beauty of the closet system is that you can tailor it to your needs... The drawback is that you only have so much ""rail"" space, and I found it more useful to have a rack or a basket accessory than shoes. By the way, rail extensions can be bought here too, which is great.","I bought two of these for my Deluxe Closet System, but returned them immediately.

Directed by KITH member Dave Foley, the whole project has an disorganized, unedited feel to it. This DVD documents the KITH during their 2000 comedy tour. We do get some choice shots of the kids performing their brilliant onstage comedy, but unfortunately not enough. What we get instead are long, rambling, backstage scenerios of the kids arguing or discussing the most trite, boring matters. Thrill as Scott Thompson can't figure out the owner's manual for a mechanical dog he purchased ( a prop for a skit) Watch as Mark McKinney gets confused over what type of makeup to wear! The audio is also awful, and I can't even hear what people are saying at times. What a shame that such a talented team produced such a boring dud of a DVD.","As the world's biggest Kids in the HallKITH fan, it is with great sadness that I write this review.

1,Doctor approved!,"My husband (a general surgeon) and I read this book on a recent trip to Texas and not only was it a fun read but a very informative one too! It's definitely an eye-opener and as parents of a 4-year old son (we can't afford to get sick!) we feel it's a must read for anyone with small children. One thing is for sure, after reading this book you'll never look at airplane blankets, hotel room comforters or department store makeup displays the same way again! You'll also be more inclined to take small steps like washing out your water bottle with soap before refilling it. Considering a cold or flu can set you back for weeks (or more!) when it only takes about 30 seconds to put into action the recommendations made in this book I couldn't agree more with the authors that I would much rather be safe than sick!","My husband a general surgeon and I read this book on a recent trip to Texas and not only was it a fun read but a very informative one too!

At least that is the impression it made after one listening, which was all I could muster before heading to the nearest used record shop to unload this aberration. My advice would be to skip this release, and head straight for Fold Your Hands Child... (their latest LP) which offers a more subtle change in direction that does not betray their body of work.","Ever since I heard the melancholic beauty of If You're Feeling Sinister I have never hesitated to pull out my wallet for the latest Belle and Sebastian release, and until now have never been dissapointed.

Alas, Folk music is Folk music, folks, and Springsteen's intrinsic tendency for the Folk-less bellowing abandons every nuance by thumping every message home and only deters from the neglected could-have-been beauty.

It is indeed correct that there's an 'open' ending; pretentious or not {I don't think it's pretentious}, Picnic... is definitely worth recommending if you like mysteries, beauty, style, and moody atmospheres.I won't attempt to describe what I thought the movie about; each may decide for his/her own whether the time was well spent or not. It sure made me think, and this is something I generally prefer to do.Scenery and soundtrack are absolutely of high-quality and do both enhance, rather than detract, the main feature.Basic story is captivating, but it's the many other 'layers' that lift the movie above a mere general plot.This is not something that I would recommend to all.","A very delicate piece of Art.This is not for everyone, I think many would be bored to tears.

I was hoping the movie soundtrack would provide more of the same, only longer.The beauty of the TV music was its mixture of eastern and western musical influences, perfectly in sync with the cultural mixture in the series. The movie soundtrack has none of that. It's modern through discordant melodies, not through new combinations of music. And it doesn't have any of the eastern, western flavors. Its standard movie music. I like Newman in general, and have other soundtracks from him. But this time I think he missed the mark both musically, and in capturing (or not) the tone of Firefly.","Im a huge fan of the TV series and the film.

It is excellent. The end title is even better than the opening because there is a bit of a lead-in that adds to its beauty. The death of Aki is another sad and beautiful piece.
0,Well written trash,"I enjoyed listening to Delillo's sentences. His skill with structure is almost poetic in that these sentences have flow and rhythm that a poet would love.Having said that, I really didn't like this book. It starts out confused, and ends up confused. Delillo could have written this in a single chapter, and he wouldn't have lost anything. The fear of death, hiding from reality in the white noise, even the sexual connotations of our world, all could have been put into one short story, and it would have been interesting, besides.The sentences have balance, flow, and beauty. The novel does not.","I enjoyed listening to Delillo's sentences.

1,Imaginative and sexy,"This is one of the most imaginative collections of erotica that I have read. The stories are fantasies or fairy tales, and they are wonderful. The author devises weird or unusual plots and premises that are all the more sensual and sexy for being out of the ordinary (and I don't mean ""perverse,"" the way that word used to be used). Highly recommended for its originality, beauty, and erotic charge.","This is one of the most imaginative collections of erotica that I have read.

1,A refreshing twist on modern ebm music,"Cesium_137's new album Elemental delivers a healthy dose of energetic electronic music. It's all generally high-bpm, and the vocal styles range from distorted to clear. The real beauty of this album is it's bravery to explore all kinds of styles...all of which are typical of the ebm genre, but the way they are implemented keeps things entertaining from beginning to end. Even though every track is original, I think the most played hits here are going to be Atrophy and Frayed. The videogamy music may turn off fans of the darker side of industrial/ebm, but Elemental is a great choice for those looking for a light-hearted guilty pleasure to throw into the mix now and then.","Cesium137's new album Elemental delivers a healthy dose of energetic electronic music.

I have found that the pen does not have a particularly long life-span after opening the sealed packages in which it is delivered. Ball-point pens have lasted much longer in my hands. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the ability to use the pen so as to give a script that simulates the use of a fountain pen. I have not worked out how this happens, or how I achieve this result, but it does give character to writing that one does not get with a ball-point.","The beauty of this product is the ease with which the pen traverses most paper stocks with a smooth output of ink, and a lack of blotchiness.

That means faster transitions from swim to bike to run since I can just keep the Garmin on my wrist.Nice to get unexpected ""features"" when buying a product.","Purchased this device to synch with my new Garmin 310XT.

Sue Miller has written a beautiful, haunting, heartbreaking story which interweaves a woman's past and present lives, and combines intelligent, mature writing and an entirely realistic storyline that could happen to anyone who was young and searching for him/herself in the 60s.

But those who criticise the book have a pointThe ending is a bit rushedThe love scenes could have been fleshed out a bit more, normally Ms Jenkins novels are not shy with their lovemaking but in this book its not as descriptive (Night Song, Topaz, Taming of Jessie Rose, Thru the storm, Winds of storm have better scenes - real hot)But still worth the read","I did enjoy reading this book.

0,"Pretentious, empty, un-musical music...","James Carter plays the saxophone decently: his tones is fat... well, actually forced, his ideas are plentiful...mostly cliches phrases and the overall music is a enormously pretentious, empty of any beauty, poetry or true emotion. Using the idea of a ""theme CD"", the great Django Reinhard's music, in order to fill the void created by that uninspired and unsubstantiated mass of effects, glissandi, etc. is simply pathetic. James Carter is another puppet of the industry who manages to survive more because of some freak showman type attitude than beacause of the sheer beauty of his playing...","James Carter plays the saxophone decently his tones is fat... well, actually forced, his ideas are plentiful...mostly cliches phrases and the overall music is a enormously pretentious, empty of any beauty, poetry or true emotion.

1,Avalon references?,"First I must say that it would be hard for me to let go of this book as it is one of the most beautifully illustrated and retold Sleeping Beauty books I have had read.The authors use of Celtic mythology and in my opinion is based on Avalon & The Lady of the Lake, Vivianne. Read it and tell me what you think?Looking closly at the illustrations the Blue Faery wears the crown of the cresent moon Symbolizing a Priestess of the Goddess.A must read!!!!!! Not short of Beautiful!","First I must say that it would be hard for me to let go of this book as it is one of the most beautifully illustrated and retold Sleeping Beauty books I have had read.The authors use of Celtic mythology and in my opinion is based on Avalon  The Lady of the Lake, Vivianne.

0,I'm Good and this Release is Very Bad,"Unless I'm missing something, and I have a very good ear for music, this release drains fluids from the parakeet and then some.

1,Helping your home school student find her inner poet,"When we just kept checking the same book out of library again and again and again, I decided Immersed in Verse would make a great Christmas present for my twelve-year-old daughter. This book helps kids become aware of the beauty of words and introduces them to different forms of poetry. I don't have to coerce my daughter to try her hand at writing her own poetry. Inspired by this book, she does this on her own, holing up on top of the bunk bed for hours at a time. We highly recommend it!","When we just kept checking the same book out of library again and again and again, I decided Immersed in Verse would make a great Christmas present for my twelve-year-old daughter.

1,breathtaking,"i cannot believe how far Sinead has come. this album speaks a lifetime of beauty; she masters the incredible task of avenging herself musically where public slander has cut her down, spitting in the faces of the tabloids with loveliness, not anger. not what you'd expect at all.i must say at first listen i was a little apprehensive. i wasn't sure what those years outside of the music industry had done to her. my fears, however, were cooled when i heard ""Dancing Lessons"" and realized she had come full circle. the piano on that track speaks so much of joy and sorrow and sexuality.this album is one of the best releases this year. i recommend it to all.","i cannot believe how far Sinead has come. this album speaks a lifetime of beauty she masters the incredible task of avenging herself musically where public slander has cut her down, spitting in the faces of the tabloids with loveliness, not anger. not what you'd expect at all.i must say at first listen i was a little apprehensive. i wasn't sure what those years outside of the music industry had done to her. my fears, however, were cooled when i heard Dancing Lessons and realized she had come full circle. the piano on that track speaks so much of joy and sorrow and sexuality.this album is one of the best releases this year. i recommend it to all."
0,Disappointed,"This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed by it. The plot was interesting enough that I stuck with it to the end, but the book was in serious need of a good editor. The author repeated herself repeatedly. I felt as though I were reading a first draft instead of a finished product. If you enjoy reading for the character development and beauty of the language as much as the plot, I do not recommend this book.","This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed by it.

0,Insufficient light,"The lighting on this mirror is insufficient even on the brightest setting. It has four small light bulbs, two blue and two white. The older lighted makeup mirrors used two elongated fluorescent bulbs which provided much brighter light. I thought it was a bargain at 21.99, but then I had to buy a desk lamp to place next to it to supplement the lighting, so it turned out to be no bargain after all. The style, the mirrors, and the magnification are good... but I consider the lighting the most important feature of a lighted make up mirror. So to me, it is a disappointment.","The lighting on this mirror is insufficient even on the brightest setting. It has four small light bulbs, two blue and two white.

0,Unfortunately Disappointed,Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light SettingsThis mirror was the bomb when I had it back in the day of my teens - I loved it. I just purchased it and am sadly disappointed by the lighting quality as even though it has several settings it's missing the one you can truly get a nice bright view to put on your makeup. I don't remember the lighting being so dark :( so now I'm shopping for something better without having to redo the lighting in my room. The quality of the product is sturdy and may do better in a highly lit room but not everyone lives in a department store setting lol. Anyway good luck if you choose this product but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a real style light ie like you have in your bathrooms or if you would like to have bright light. It really is odd lighting colors.,Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w4 Light SettingsThis mirror was the bomb when I had it back in the day of my teens - I loved it.

1,Excellent movie--excellent acting,"I came across this movie while looking through the Amazon Instant Movies. I watched it and was amazed on how good it was.It is not a fast action movie but one that told a story about a woman who had to fight to do what she believed was right. In a time when women were not supposed to have opinions about government, Thatcher had to prove that she was the right person to be elected to Parliment.Meryl Streep (a very good actor in her own right) did an excellent job of protraying Margret Thatcher. The way her makeup was done, she looked so much like Margret Thatcher.The movie shows how she came from humble biginnings and how she became one of the most power woman (other than the Queen) in Britian. It also shows how she had to fight the male dominated establishment and won.","I came across this movie while looking through the Amazon Instant Movies.

1,Callas' famous Covent Garden debut,"Norma had not been sung at Covent Garden since Rosa Ponselle's glorious performances until Callas arrived in 1952 and triumphed incredibly. Joan Sutherland, later to be a great Norma and the sweet Clothilde on this set, describes how she stayed close to the stage to listen to the ""incredible beauty of Maria's and Ebe's singing"". Sills said she took Callas' singing as a role-model for her own Norma, as did Caballe and Sutherland. (They all said it, it can be read and heard in many sources) Sills adored Callas so much that she said ""I'd rather have five years of Maria instead of twenty of myself"". Of course she would never have done that but it's a sweet, respectful gesture towards the older colleague and inspiration. This Norma will take your breath away. If Joan Sutherland was satisfied, then you will be too!","Norma had not been sung at Covent Garden since Rosa Ponselle's glorious performances until Callas arrived in 1952 and triumphed incredibly.

0,Hurry through this one!,"What a disapointment. I love the William Monk series. I read Sins of the Wolf in three days and and quickly decided it was my favorite. Cain His Brother was just as compelling of a read and the details of Limehouse, the typhoid hospital and especially the chase seen were amazing. Couldn't wait to read this book, but quickly found that I couldn't wait for it to end. Ms. Perry's research on Victorian England is second to none, but I found this story in particular very forgetable. I agree with one reviewer that Hester's contribution to solving the cases is sometimes better than Monk's or Rathbone. Thank goodness Monk is finally starting to figure out that Hester's courage, friendship and brains is more attractive than beauty. Don't waste much time on this book, except to find out who did it and the next step in Monk's and Hester's relationship.","What a disapointment. I love the William Monk series.

Before you say,""you must be putting in too much water"", let me assure you I've never had this problem with my trusty, if unsightly, old rice cooker I bought in chinatown. Do I want an appliance for which I have to modify the recipe in order to make it work properly? No, I don't. Also, the steamer basket is so small as to be fairly useless in this 4-cup model from Cuisinart.

1,I WAS WRONG,"I recently posted a review, entitled MILDLY AMUSING, where I gave his game a so-so review...I now take that back.DEAD OR ALIVE 2 wasn't the greatest as a one player game, but for two players, it's a great fighter. Particularly when both players understand the beauty of the counter attacks. My brother and I spent the better part of July 4 brawling and had a blast!I haven't played SOUL CALIBUR is weeks (you can only play a game so long), and DEAD OR ALIVE 2 seems like the best follow up.The action is really fast, the graphics are great, and the character's are pretty good.

1,"Yes, and more.","The question Amazon asks is ""Does it meet your expectations?"" Yes it does, and more. I find it even more beautiful and addictive than Sedona. I have listened many times since I have bought it, both in the evening and while driving. I also have awakened to it. Sometimes waking can be jarring, but this suite, with its lilt and calm beauty began a day for me with serenity and beauty. I am no music expert and cannot speak to technical merit or compare this music with other pieces. But it is very fulfilling for me to listen to. With a recent and grave unhappiness in my life, this music also comforts me, again with its serenity and soft beauty. Even driving, I appreciate it. I usually drive to loud uptempo music, but I have found that the music of Barabas keeps me at a steady relaxed keel without jangling nerves. I know that this does not speak as a critical review, but it does speak to my great satisfaction while listening to this lovely lovely composition.","The question Amazon asks is Does it meet your expectations?

0,From Back Cover,"Hell-bent on protecting his family's interests, commanding corporate tycoon Jordan Westcott never counted on crossing paths with the most-beguiling beauty he'd ever met when he decided to spend his summer vacation incognito, helping out his grandfather's struggling Big Top Circus. Unfortunately for Jordan, however, virgin spitfire Mistral St. Michel thought he was only a slick lion tamer, intent on taking advantage of her and the circus she managed. And like a lioness protecting her lair, she wasn't about to let anything --- or anyone --- sabotage her precious labor of love. No man had ever come close to claiming the tempestuous Mistral as his own --- until this dark, electrifying stranger she didn't dare trust awakened a fierce hunger in her that defied all reason. Was it foolhardy for her to relinquish her carefully guarded virtue to this magnificent man of mystery --- or would it be the true fulfillment of all her deepest desires?","Hell-bent on protecting his family's interests, commanding corporate tycoon Jordan Westcott never counted on crossing paths with the most-beguiling beauty he'd ever met when he decided to spend his summer vacation incognito, helping out his grandfather's struggling Big Top Circus.

There was no-one that this creep wouldn't use, and when he's quite justifiably refused ""good samaritan"" help, he rants and raves about how unfair it all is.His writing is nothing more than egocentric drivel about how brilliant and brave he is. Nothing about the beauty, the people or the history.The journey was remarkable, but Starkells stupidity, incompetance, lack of planning and astonishing lack of ethics are a study on how not to make this type of journey. His methods of resupply consisted of sponging off people who likely couldn't afford it and stealing the rest.Please don't buy this book.

After reading Dr. Fulton's book, I came to terms with accepting that I have acne and that I can only control it to have clear skin, which I do now.

Dr. Fulton writes from experience, having been born with acne as a newborn and having suffered with it his whole life.This book is not meant to cure acne. However, it does offer a basic regimen for treating it at home. I recommend this book to any person in the dermatology or esthetic field.

We listen to the news on the radio because we want to know and when that is too much we listen to this album - not to forget or to distract, but rather to envelop ourselves in a trusted and familiar voice - a voice that continues to find beauty in friends and simple pleasures, a voice that can tremble with truth and still hold you secure. I find in this music what I want most these days - an integration of politics and beauty, of what needs mending (and fast!) with what is so right and just and sweet and all around us. I'm grateful for the companionship of this music and recommend it highly to anyone who craves justice brewed in rich soulful beauty.","This album has been played in our home more than any other in the last few weeks.

It's very easy to use.3 You should never use any product that is actually paint, produced to be used on craft items, on your skin for this or any type of art on your body.4 Non-toxic rating does not mean a product is skin safe.5 For optimum results consider contacting a Professional Face  Body Artist to complete your project.Thank you for using safe professional products should you decide to attempt a project like this."
1,It's a piece of history,"It is true that this album is a crude ""hand made"" piece of art and that younger listeners may have trouble appreciating it's beauty. It is not as tasty as Paul's RAM or as well fabricated as Red Rose Speedway, but it does capture the flavor and atmosphere of Paul and Linda's life during the transitional period of Paul's move to solo superstardom. Bip Bop sounds as if it came straight from Paul's garage and Tomorrow can make your palms sweatt like a little love note from your honey. The album has an incredibly personal feel to it. Band On the Run and later Paul LP's got far, far away from this down-home style. If you like Paul, buy Wild Life. If you don't like Paul so much then see Smashing Pumpkins.","It is true that this album is a crude hand made piece of art and that younger listeners may have trouble appreciating it's beauty.

1,The new masterpiece by the Church,"I've been a fan of The Church since I was thirteen. The only other band I hold in higher regard is Talk Talk. The Church has held my attention over the years as Talk Talk has, and with Talk Talk, their album ""Laughing Stock"" has for me been their pinnacle, and indispensible to my life.Now, ""Forget Yourself"" takes it's place beside ""Laughing Stock"" as one of my 'desert island"" CDs. ""Forget Yourself"" is a stunning accomplishment. It is no holds barred, damn the reviews; an enigmatic, effects laden work of absolute beauty. Kilbey, Wilson-Piper, Koppes, and Powles are at the top of their inventiveness, and I thank them whole heartedly for their efforts. With each repeated listen, the album grows on me, much the way Talk Talk did. For fans, this is the Church at their very best.","I've been a fan of The Church since I was thirteen.

1,"A flashy, fun Bach recital","Fazil Say's Bach recital is amazing for it's variety and breadth: it begins with the lucid, intimate beauty of the 6th French Suite (in which Say's playing is unusually sensual, with the recording balance just warm enough to match his playing style) and climbs to the mountainous Liszt and Busoni transcriptions. The Liszt is wonderfully colorful and dramatic, an underrated work that is smashing in Say's tense and fiery reading. Say ends the disc with the the famous C major Prelude and Fugue from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier, a move that could seem pat but works very well; the tender arpeggios of the Prelude dispel the epic anguish of the Bach/Busoni ""Chaconne"" and close the disc in innocent wonder.I look forward to another Bach recital from this delightful artist; perhaps next time he can push the Bach-playing envelope with recomposition/improvisation? Or a transcription of his own?","Fazil Say's Bach recital is amazing for it's variety and breadth it begins with the lucid, intimate beauty of the 6th French Suite in which Say's playing is unusually sensual, with the recording balance just warm enough to match his playing style and climbs to the mountainous Liszt and Busoni transcriptions.

1,Melted Chocolate Again,"I owned one at $50.00 and loved it. I am a Chef Instructor, and I used the chocolate fountain for a variety of personal and professional activities. Then I dropped it in a parking lot. All four plastic motor mounts snapped. A quick search on Amazon brought up this beauty at only $29.99. Need I say more - melted chocolate is mine again. Not only is it easy to use, it is easy to clean. Unlike some other home fountains, the bowl and moving parts sepearte from the motor for convenient washing. I only lowered the rating to 4 as a caution to the user. This fountain, although fun for everyone, is a home model. It has performed admirably at the events we have taken it to, but it's plastic construction makes a lot of travel and rough handling a risk.","I owned one at 50.00 and loved it.

1,"Beautiful story, beautiful illustrations","Ms. Brett has such an incredible talent for children's books! While reading this book I was enchanted by her tale of Fritz, a shetland (?) pony who was exiled from a city due to his stocky appearance. In the end this pony saves the day but not before a disaster happens on the road to the great city.An excellent choice for a library, one that any child (although especially a horse-loving child) will want to read again and again. Ms. Brett's illustrations always set her books apart from her fellow authors and this book is no exception. She captures the life and beauty of every horse and pony in her book.I believe that this is a second-grade reading level book although any age is certain to enjoy this story.","Ms. Brett has such an incredible talent for children's books!

0,Do NOT buy this video!,"This has got to be the documentary with the WORST production value ever made. The camera work is unstable, the lighting is horrible and the narration will put you to sleep in about two minutes.

You would think in 50 minutes that there would be a few beauty shots of the temples, but instead, there are a lot of shaky close-ups on the bas reliefs...too close to really tell what you are looking at. I have visited these temples, and this documentary does not do justice to the majestic atmosphere that you will encounter. Also, the scenes of the temples are hazy, as if they didn't use any contrast filters at all. It just makes the buildings look flat and plain.

1,"Not LES MIS, but a good score","Though MISS SAIGON is not flawless in its structure, it is very moving. The score is emotional, if not particuarly memorable, and the performances of the three leads are fantastic, especially Lea Salonga's title role. The highlights CD does, however, does contain very few songs in comparison to the double disk set, and I think it is better to spend the extra fourteen dollars to get the whole thing. My only real complaint about the show in general is that it doesn't focus enough on the two main characters-Kim and Chris. Instead, most of the songs are given to the Engineer, creating a political story about coming to America rather than the Romeo and Juliet romance it was meant to be. While the Engineer should be a supporting character, he is really the lead and casts a shadow over the beauty of the love story.","Though MISS SAIGON is not flawless in its structure, it is very moving.

I was aware of the Jim Harrison novella and Kevin Costner still hadn't squandered his talent. I had a hard time explaining why it intrigued me until I realized that it was a true romance. Medieval in concept, merely updated. Costner is the knight-errant, Anthony Quinn the evil baron who has locked Costner's true love, Madeleine Stowe, away in a 'tower'. Though it's not as heart wrenching as I thought as a younger man, there is enough mystery in some of the images to hold my attention.And then, there's Madeleine Stowe, a true raven-haired beauty. Enough to stir the imagination of even an aging boomer.","This movie is a guilty pleasure for me. I was one of the few who enjoyed it when it was first released.

0,Where's Jane?,"Among the many things missing from this novel, the most important is any trace of Jane Austen. The author ""helpfully"" gives unhelpful one-paragraph plot summaries of the six Austen novels at the back of the book. Reduced to squibs, they read like one act TV soaps. I found this device discouraging and off-putting.The members of the ""club"" itself come weighed down with lengthy back stories. They include a dog breeder, a divorcée and her lesbian daughter, an older single woman, and a young man of unknown gender preference who demonstrates an incredible lack of knowledge of or feeling for, the novels.The actual discussions center more around the psychological makeup and motives of Austen's characters than her writing itself or any of her literary accomplishments.

0,Author is an Air Head & anti-feminist!,"i HATE this author because her book only described women in their physical tersm. primarily, whether they were a 'dusky beauty' or otherwise, all women are 'plain' in her mind. She is not enlightened at all about the various challenges women face. she is only concerned with how well they cook, clean & please their husbands. she offered hardly any insight into shiite muslim woman's world. i'm disgusted to find out she is has received so much acclaim as a 'feminist', author & professor (her obsession with superficial design elements may allow her to make so-so films but she should not be a well-received author!). She's an air head.

0,Creepy,"This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it.","This is a beautiful but creepy book a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child.

1,Ziegfeld Follies,"This book was amazing! I enjoyed looking at all the wonderful and beautiful pictures. Mr. Johnson had a real talent in bringing out true mystery and beauty in these women. At the time these were considered ""racy"" if only those critics could see what pictures are like today! I wish we had more photographers like this now, a little mystery is always better than the whole package in my opinion. The eyes are drawn to the lighting, the props and back drops, jewelry dangling, the scarfs seductively placed just right. A true work of art. Also interesting were the side stories about the women and their lives. Often tragic, some surprising but always interesting! I was thrilled to find how many pictures were included so many that I had not seen before. It is a great read for anyone facinated with the era.","This book was amazing!

0,politics or art?,"I was hoping, when I saw this CD, for some serious reflections on the human conditon. But, as with Neal Young's Living with War I was presented with shallow, banal social commentary. You would think, listening to these tunes, that Mellencamp thinks his country is the one that should seek forgiveness; that his country is one that is intolerant; that his country is one wreaking havoc on the world. In many places I thought I was hearing Mellencamp sing the words he had read in some editorial, or left-winged hack journal. I know that some artists feel guilty about their success and feel compelled to make a statement, but please, do it somewhere else. Let us hope that say, Neal Young, returns to the beauty and art of Praire Wind, and Mellencamp too, returns to what he does well: music, music that is thoughtful and worth obtaining.","I was hoping, when I saw this CD, for some serious reflections on the human conditon.

1,An amazing series,"The emphasis is on life in Northern Alaska. This is a reagon so remote that the only way in or out is on an airplane. The series follows the lives of an Aviation family, the Twetos based out of Unakleet, a small town of not more than 700 people. The series follows the matriarch, Jim (COO and President of Era Alaska), Ferno (Wife and Unakleet station manager) and their Daughter Ariel.The series shows what life is like in the 49th state, where you have to hunt for your meat or it comes from the sea. There are also different traditions with the locals. The series shows the remoteness and the beauty of the state and the flying footage is fantastic. You also get a look into life with the Twetos and you meet some of the people that they transports. The series will also showcase some of the other pilots that work for the company.A well done series, it well worth anybody's addition to their video library. A wonderful series for Aviation fans and those who love the 49th state.","The emphasis is on life in Northern Alaska. This is a reagon so remote that the only way in or out is on an airplane.

1,The soundtrack to coffee-table LSD summertimes.,"This is where Joni Mitchell stops being simply a beautiful folk visionary, and starts making music for which there can be no exaggerated description. This is a masterful journey through the mind's subconscious eye...aware only of the beauty of yesterday's sunshine. Sublime melancholy flows vividly through entwined, cabbalistic chord sequences which defy category. Based in jazz ethics yes, but transported somewhere else...somewhere greener and warmer. This record is Joni's 'Pet Sounds'. Only Better","This is where Joni Mitchell stops being simply a beautiful folk visionary, and starts making music for which there can be no exaggerated description.

This is a masterpiece of noise-core brutality and very emotional heaviness, one of the most honest records I've ever heard.

1,Interesting Book,"In this book, the author discusses the origins of locks, ""dreadlocks vs locks"", and the myths associated with locked hair. Excellent encouragement for people who have locks or anyone who is just thinking about it. This book encourages acceptance of African ""coiled"" hair, and shows that beauty does not only have to be Eurocentric. I agree with the author's statements that once African-Americans lock their hair, they ""fall in love with it."" To me, this means that a person with locked hair has accepted their natural hair and all of it's quirks and knows that beauty comes in all hair textures. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a ""how-to"" book.","In this book, the author discusses the origins of locks, dreadlocks vs locks, and the myths associated with locked hair.

1,Intricate and lovely,"Hauntingly beautiful melodies from the ancient and medieval times are combined in this album with creative percussion lines and rhythms. This makes for a unique blend of complex and intricate music that still remains truly listenable. The melodies are modal and based in the chant tradition, but the rhythmic additions make the music more accessible to modern ears than strict chant.A favorite track of mine is ""De Profundis,"" which opens with a vocal chant and then melds into a poignant and uplifting melodic line. The forward movement of the piece is carried through by the raindrop-like percussion in the background.The artistry of the Empire Brass Quintet amazes me. At times brass ensembles feel too ""brassy"" for my taste; this group brings out all of the beauty and sensitivity of its instruments. The album encompasses the range from majestic to intimate, and should not be missed.","Hauntingly beautiful melodies from the ancient and medieval times are combined in this album with creative percussion lines and rhythms.

1,"Skip the driving range, do the yoga","If golf is the most mental of sports, and yoga the most mental of exercise, it makes a lot of sense to fuse the two. I have tried it and took 6 strokes off my game the first time after doing the exercises. And the beauty is, you can do the exercises at home, and some can be done in the car on the way to the course, such as the deep breathing, relaxation techniques. And on the course many yoga exercises can be snuck in while others just wouldn't be appropriate outside a gym. Before I hit the links tomorrow, I'm going to hit ""The Missing Peace"" and do those loosening warm-ups. The book is well-organized, well-illustrated, easy to use, but most of all it satisfies a need in many golfers that often has gone unmet--unless they've read the book or practice yoga.","If golf is the most mental of sports, and yoga the most mental of exercise, it makes a lot of sense to fuse the two.

1,Versatile Portrait Lens,"F/1.4 -- need I say more? I suppose, for sake of the review, I do.The lens is sturdy and has the feel of quality. The photos come out great to the outer edges. The large aperture allows for tremendous depth-of-field versatility. Speaking of versatility... Although this lens is the ideal portrait lens, it is easily flexible enough to capture brilliant landscapes as well. The large aperture makes dusk, dawn, and night time shots easier and most of the time the tripod doesn't make it out of the case. It also has allowed me to take shots of beauty pageants and clubs in minimal light without having to succumb to the graininess of a high ISO setting or the poor lighting given by a direct flash to the face. Did I mention the large aperture? Finally, the price is right. I would be happy with this lens even if I paid twice the price. Thankfully (for my marriage's sake) I only paid the listed price.","F1.4 -- need I say more? I suppose, for sake of the review, I do.The lens is sturdy and has the feel of quality.

0,Not a whole lot of fun,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday. She has not played with it at all since the day she got it. It comes with extra items that you can ""buy"" but most are just empty cardboard boxes. She does like the fake makeup though. The cash register is very realistic, which means it gives you a beeping error message if you don't press the keys in the right order. Overall I would say it is not very fun, and I wish I would have gotten her something else!","My daughter got this for her 4th birthday. She has not played with it at all since the day she got it.

1,Sweeter and more French than creme brulee.,"In ""Amelie,"" Jean-Pierre Jeunet employs the whole panoply of Nouvelle Vague camera and narrative tricks first used by Truffaut, Godard and Malle. He uses them in the service of a sweet, funny story about a young waitress who decides to become the secret benefactress of her eccentric neighbors in Montmartre. The camera charges, darts, swirls and loops as Amelie plays matchmaker, reunites middle-aged men with boyhood treasures, wreaks quiet havoc on the life of a nasty grocer who berates his mentally challenged assistant. The camerawork is incredible, and in Audrey Tautou--with her confiding grin and Louise Brooks-meets-Leslie Caron beauty--Jeunet has found an actress eminently worth photographing. This film, being French, is blase about the existence of sex shops, orgasms, etc., so the blue-nosed be warned. The rest of us will respond with joy to the sunny, stylized Paris of ""Amelie.""","In Amelie, Jean-Pierre Jeunet employs the whole panoply of Nouvelle Vague camera and narrative tricks first used by Truffaut, Godard and Malle.

I was anxiously awaiting a copy of ""Haddon Hall"" but canceled it when I found out who produced it.

0,It's just cheap clear nailpolish! (:(,"#1. It has FARMALDEHUYDE ! Per WebMD: ""Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate.""#2. How on earth does putting this on top of the nailpolish penetrate the nailpolish to strengthen the nail under it?! It doesn't! That just goes to prove that it's the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it's actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.I was shocked when i put it on to see that it's basically just clear nail polish and not something that penetrates the nail it's self to strengthen it! It's just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!).","1. It has FARMALDEHUYDE !

0,Mislead,"I ordered Lancome Color Focus Exceptional Wear Smooth Eye Colour from Amazon.com. It arrived very quickly from a company called Beauty Encounter on Amazon based in California. (18480 Pacific Street, Fountain Valley, CA 92708, Tel: 1-714-845-5937). I suffer severe allergies to cosmetics and thought that if I purchase a high end eye shadow that my allergies would not act up. I was wrong, my eyes swell, get red rimmed, water, itch, and develope a rash at the corners. I was naive because fine department stores and my local drug stores all accept returned cosmetics due to allergies. Amazon is a wonderful place to shop, and I will continue to shop Amazon. BEWARE OF BEAUTY ENCOUNTER, AS THEY DO NOT ACCEPT REFUNDS OF OPENED MERCHANDISE. YOU DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO A COSMETIC UNLESS YOU OPEN AND TRY IT!!! I did not read the nearly hidden return policy, and will never purchase from this company again!!!","I ordered Lancome Color Focus Exceptional Wear Smooth Eye Colour from Amazon.com.

1,Gardening for real people,"The way this book is written, you can sit down with it and flip to any random section, and be totally entertained while being informed. It's a book I never tire of thumbing through. She has lots of interesting insights into how to make things work, but she cuts to the chase, keeping each section short. I learn something new every time I open it, and I have been gardening for 10 years. It is written for the urban young gardener with a tight space, but I live in the suburbs with a medium to small back yard, and find it totally relevant.There are also several different projects for off season, such as sewing a simple garden apron, making seed packets, making beauty products (did you know you can grow your own loofah??), that have encouraged me, a completely non-crafty person, to venture into new areas.I have to say, other than the fabulous pictures, my favorite thing about this book is her completely readable and hilarious tone throughout the entire book.","The way this book is written, you can sit down with it and flip to any random section, and be totally entertained while being informed.

1,Fantabulous!,"This is one of my favorite books of all time that I think tests the limits of what we call literature, it is probably one of the best contemporary novels that I would put into the catagory of postmodernism. We literally mind-surf into several characters heads and see whats going on, the characters all interlink through a story of a much larger scope and Bogosian creates a satire of American culture rival to that of American Beauty or anything in recent memory. This would make a great film, do not believe the naysayers, Bogosian is a very talented writer and I cannot wait until his next novel comes out.","This is one of my favorite books of all time that I think tests the limits of what we call literature, it is probably one of the best contemporary novels that I would put into the catagory of postmodernism.

0,Big mistake,"Don't buy a siphon type sand blaster,especially this one! Cheap is cheap...this one is as cheap as they come. Used it for about an hour and it was a pain to use. I should have known better. I was using fine grit black beauty blast media,and my compressor was more than big enough. I was using a 10HP 240V 3-phase 150 gallon compressor running 125psi. So air pressure wasn't the issue. It's just a cheap unit. I'm sorry I ever bought this product. I did my research and purchased a pressurized sand blast unit. I'm not doing anything heavy, just removing paint on a 73 VW and just wanted something to work. I got sucked in by the reviews and spent money I didn't need to. Do your homework! Siphon type systems just don't perform like a pressurized unit. I hope this review keeps someone from buying this piece of crap.","Don't buy a siphon type sand blaster,especially this one!

1,Senses at attention...,"Mr. Shapiro is a storyteller. The journey runner Bob Dylan. Slick Rick. Johnny Cash. His words captivate and affect. Brush strokes drawn from the experiencial pallete of a colorful character, they allow others to accompany him on a journey of self-exploration and realization. Having had the good fortune of knowing Mr. Shapiro - he was my grade school teacher, cross-country and track coach and remains my friend and mentor - I expected something deep and real from the record of his transcon run. As usual the modest poet and philosopher left me marveling at his feats of body and mind, inspired to rise to my own. Beauty at its essence, Meditations is like a clear pool on an overcast day. If you look at it long enough you will see not only the surface but what lies beneath. Look again and you may find that you too are dancing with the soft water. I highly recommend Meditations From the Breakdown Lane to any and all.","Mr. Shapiro is a storyteller. The journey runner Bob Dylan. Slick Rick. Johnny Cash. His words captivate and affect.

1,Subtle and natural,"I like to use this, along with a few other Benefit products for a very natural ""no makeup"" look.

1,"A dark, many layered book.","""The Hero and the Crown"" is the darkest of McKinley's books, but in some ways the best. While it lacks the sweet magical charm that makes ""Beauty"" so enjoyable, it is in many ways more satisfying. The world of Damar is much darker in this book then it is in ""The Blue Sword"" and the tension can almost be seen, seeping from underneath. The writing is, I think, some of the best I've ever seen. It draws you right away into Damar, and does not allow you to escape it: a feeling which at times is uncomfortable. The book haunted me for days.The presance of Aerin's motherr is always felt, lingering in the background, and influencing her relationship with everyone.

1,Enthusiastic sadomasochism,"Skillful narrative, amazing events; hideousness and beauty; attention to sexual (and historical) details, gruesome and original plot. But there's a chilly lack of heart in this novel which all the brains and visual effects in the world can't fix. One of the characters, Blanche, says of her brother, ""His eyes revealed more than the usual contempt common to his kind of Englishman (...) pure hatred."" Flanagan's meticulous emotionless descriptions almost seem like a form of cruelty.On second thought, is that the point? Puzzling.","Skillful narrative, amazing events hideousness and beauty attention to sexual and historical details, gruesome and original plot.

1,Great Watch,"I have wanted a Swiss Army Ladies Officers watch for a couple of years, but could not afford one at the full retail price. When I found this one on Amazon I could not pass it up. I love the watch and it is everything I wanted it to be. The only negative is that I chose the black face instead of the white and I find the date to be a little difficult to read in low light. But that was strictly a cosmetic choice and since I feel the black is a little more dressy than the white, I do not have any regrets. It fits the wrist very nicely, and I have a 6 1/2"" wrist, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well it laid against the skin. I did have to take it to a jeweler to have the band adjusted because the screws were so small that even using an eye glass screwdriver, the head was too big for the size screws. But that only cost an additional $5, so dollar for dollar, this watch is a great buy. I highly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking for the Swiss Army Ladies Officer style watch.","I have wanted a Swiss Army Ladies Officers watch for a couple of years, but could not afford one at the full retail price.

1,Unknown classics,"Anatol Lyadov is one of the more recent Russian composers of the Romance period, and one of the less popular. This might be due to his small canon of works, for surely it is not due to its quality. This CD contains many of Lyadov's best works. Their inspirations included Russian folk music, music for stage performances, and music for ceremonies. Regardless of the inspiration, the result is beauty. The pieces range from dramatic to soft in mood, but all are firmly in the style of Russian romantic classics.

1,The Slowness of Muisc,"For the music itself, it is a beauty, but not abstract trio jazz. The bassist provides a moderate and less aggressive support to the body with and occasionally randomly arranged solos, while the drummer is felt rather than heard for most time. The subtle piano improvisations mesh elegant whispers in an atmosphere of slowness. What does slowness mean to music? I barely realized that before I knew the band Red House Painters from San Francisco, playing music as slow as if time has frozen, and was labeled as sadcore music.Yes! The band definitely gives me a cross-genre feeling of Red House Painter, but tells a different story - a story about the beauty of slowness of music.","For the music itself, it is a beauty, but not abstract trio jazz.

0,Very unimportant research.,"This dissertation investigations problems of the mate-in-two variety, and shows that a few heuristics that correspond to the human concept of ""beauty"" tend to reduce solution times (10% to 33%). My disappointment arises because this is not a difficult problem; there isn't a chess program on the marketplace that can't solve mate-in-N problems in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, the advantage obtained through these heuristics is very minor; on a small sample of positions it is always possible to tune one's chess engine to obtain comparable speed-ups. My conclusion is that the author's time at the University of Sussex was not well spent.","This dissertation investigations problems of the mate-in-two variety, and shows that a few heuristics that correspond to the human concept of beauty tend to reduce solution times 10 to 33.

1,A moving work of understated elegance,"""Streams"" is a CD that is so beautifully understated that it draws you into its beauty in such a way that you experience it rather than just listen to it. This first ten songs on this generous work (it is well over fifty minutes long) are by various contemporary Christian artists, with some guests. Michelle Tume's ""Hold On,"" Chris Rodriguez's ""Sanctuary,"" Sixpence's ""Breathe,"" and Delirious? with Amy Grant's ""Find Me In The River"" are among the best vocal offerings -- but every vocal by all the artists is a work of musical tapestry that lends itself to repeated listenings. The orchestral suite is very good, but seems somewhat tacked on as filler.

This was not a good buy and it took almost a week to arrive when it offered quick delivery. I was very happy with another product from Amazon, which arrived in two days, but not the beauty product."
0,eXistenZ worth it?,"Normally, i would not go to a movie like this, but by accident we were confronted with it. While technically there is some beauty, even probably new visual content to it, the story was not understandable to me. The mood in it was like a bad dream, fear and desperation reigned. By the end of the movie, i wanted to immediately forget about this experience. Depression is not a particularly creative expression. By flashing back, i only could feel sorry for the wasted talent of the persons involved with production and execution, and the finances withhold for more significant and enlightening projects.","Normally, i would not go to a movie like this, but by accident we were confronted with it.

1,"A great idea, wonderfully executed.","I bought this album being a huge Metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations. To be very honest, I was expecting something a little bit different, more in line with the stuff that Metheny plays with his group and so it took me a little time to appreciate its true beauty. But, over the last 2 weeks, the album has really grown on me. ""Nascente"" and ""Sometimes I See"" are just superb, wonderfully arranged, and with great solos. Metheny's note choice, on the whole, is exquisite as usual and so is Brecker's and Hancock's. James Taylor also sings wonderfully on his two appearances lending a distinct charm to the album. I would highly recommend this work to everyone.","I bought this album being a huge Metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations.

1,Beautiful homes,I really like Veranda for the beautiful homes they showcase. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because while it is so much fun to look at all the beauty not everyone has such grand homes. I did get some good decorating ideas from the magazine but just not practical for my lifestyle.,I really like Veranda for the beautiful homes they showcase.

1,BRILLIANT!,"I loved this book!

0,music intended to portray spiritual death,"I saw KOYAANISQATSI when it was first released in 1983 at a special showing outdoors at the Petrillo Bandshell in Grant Park in Chicago. It was a powerful experience, with the city skyline for a backdrop. I well recall my feeling at the time, that the images were provocative and moving, but the music was intensely annoying. I WANT to like it. I fully sympathize with the message of the film, which is that our ""civilization"" is out of balance with ""nature."" I absolutely believe that we need nothing less than an ecological revolution before we destroy any more of the planet. Compassion for all sentient beings! But after repeated listening, I find the soundtrack to be yet another symptom of our out-of-sync society. I have the same reaction to most of Glass's music.If you are interested in minimalism, I recommendTerry Riley's IN CandSteve Reich's MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS(see my reviews of both). These are works of beauty that may be part of the cure.Namasthe!","I saw KOYAANISQATSI when it was first released in 1983 at a special showing outdoors at the Petrillo Bandshell in Grant Park in Chicago.

1,Spike Jonze is THE MAN!,"This is my third favorite film behind American Beauty and Magnolia. I must say that is probably the most original film I've seen in a long, long time. Granted the themes aren't that original, but the ways that the characters go about getting to their goals is just insane. Jonze's use of dull colors to downplay the emotion of the story. The actors are awesome. John Cusack's character is the greatest sad character I've ever scene. Charlie Kaufman has a great up and coming career in Hollywood and I'm interested in whether he'll eventually begin to direct his own work. I'm looking foward to his next project Adaptation.","This is my third favorite film behind American Beauty and Magnolia.

1,A Haunting Film Experience,"This film is definitely flawed, yet despite its flaws (or maybe because of them) I found myself fascinated and drawn to THE THIN RED LINE. The film is slow and contemplative and it does have some narrative problems. On the first viewing, I had trouble telling whose voice over I was listening to. Despite all this, the film resonates deeply with me. The contrasts between the beauty and the darkness of man's nature (and of nature itself) are haunting. The beauty of the score and the images is almost overwhelming. The film is not a traditional type of war film (it actually is much less traditional than the excellent SAVING PRIVATE RYAN which was promoted as breaking the mold of old war films) and would be a big let down for someone expecting that type of film. For people who want a slower more contemplative look at human nature, the film is deeply satisfying. It is to me one of the finest and most interesting American films that has been made in the last decade.","This film is definitely flawed, yet despite its flaws or maybe because of them I found myself fascinated and drawn to THE THIN RED LINE.

1,Sultry...Sexy...Sweet,"I bought this album on a whim after hearing ""Raincoat"" on the radio and falling in love with it. Sometimes it is worth buying a CD even when you do not know what the songs are going to be like just because the voice makes it worth it. With this album, however, I was NOT disappointed. Every song is fantastic and I absolutely LOVE Sweet's voice. Her songs range from classical to a sexy pop sound. The only thing that does not change is the beauty in her voice. Few people could pull such an album off- but she certainly does. ""We Are One"" is my current favorite, but I love her version of Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" also as well as ""Crush"". Buy it and enjoy it over and over and over again- I am.","I bought this album on a whim after hearing Raincoat on the radio and falling in love with it.

I will not mention brands, but I have used my neighbor's $400.00 one, and this one is easier to push, and does a more thorough job.I remember one of the complaints being that it was very loud...what vacuum isn't.? It certainly would not warrant not buying it for that reason. I would recommend this to anyone out searching for a new vacuum, but I just hope that five years from now I can still say the same.....after seeing what other models are priced at, I cannot believe I got this beauty for $70.00 If I had to think of one possible thing I would change in it, it would be for a longer cord...but that it the lazy in me.....so that I don't have to go and unplug it when I want to use it 3 rooms away.........","I am so pleased with this vacuum cleaner...I cannot believe what you get for the money.

1,for a grand listen that will leave you breathless,"Perhaps one most under rated bands ever. Really one the very best sounds to come out of the UK during 80s-90s. There was a particular sound emitted during this time period from bands like Joy Division, the Chameleons, and Cocteau Twins that was unmatched in its melon collie beauty and certainly Lowlife is the cream of the crop. Because the band chose to remain low key they never achieved the fame they deserved, but even after some 20 years that still command a dedicated and loyal fan base. This new compilation is wonderful overview of the Lowlife's most creativity and beautiful years and will give the listener the chance to experience the unmatched voice quality Craig Lorentson and the unusual guitar quality of Will Heggie and Stuart Everest. Once fairly rare now Lowlife's music is available for a grand listen that will leave you breathless.","Perhaps one most under rated bands ever.

0,Still trying to wash the STINK off,"Whew! Unlike the others below, I hadn't seen ""Ghost Watcher One,"" but was unlucky enough to pick this up at the library.

Directing, acting, cinematography and story are all uniformly bad, along with ridiculous makeup. ""The Dude"" below, is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking. And what's with the towel over the bedroom door??? Attention Aspiring Filmmakers: you should watch this as inspiration that you don't need an Academy Award winning script to get your movie made. It will make you feel like your Francis Ford Coppola, David Lean and Steven Spielberg all rolled into one.

""Kuru/Speak Like A Child"" ain't bad either.The bonus tracks are alright, but the general album is more interesting.In my opinion, one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished, if not the accomplished player of all time!","This album is absolutely amazing!

0,No sympathy for this narrator,"I agree with much of what Abby said, below. This book is very disappointing. If you are expecting a fun, witty Helen Fielding-style book, you're going to be disappointed.Tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it. It feels forced. But the main problem I have with this book is that the main character, Louise, is very unappealing. She comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed. Tessaro obviously wants us to think ""you go, girl!"" when Louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands' colleagues; instead, I marvelled at how I was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things. Finally, the whole premise of the book is weak - that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup, you can transform your life. Louise may become more physically attractive, but that doesn't change the fact that her character, like this book, leaves much to be desired.","I agree with much of what Abby said, below.

1,Favorite McPhee,"Oranges was my first and remains my most favorite McPhee book! I have always been a fan of non-books: dictionaries, almanacs, encyclopedia. So, McPhee's Oranges certainly resonated with me. He is one of the few authors of non-fiction who writes beautifully - even his lists are fantastic. Oranges shows in a succinct format the beauty and creativity possible in natural history writing, especially when nature is so entertwined with culture. I have recommended Oranges to my friends and colleagues who like natural history, food, and/or poetry.Oranges is a must-read.

1,A performance for the ages,"Shamefully, I knew nothing of Edith Piaf's spectacular life before seeing this film. It is a fascinating tale of triumph and tragedy, of incredible talent and unavoidable madness. Marion Cotillard's performance is one of the great characterizations of all time. Forget the makeup (ok, it was great -- let's move on), she captured Edith's innocence, her longing, her triumph and her descent in an incredibly moving way.My wife is not a fan of subtitled movies, finding them a distraction. She voiced no such opposition to this gem. The director's use of flashback and forward was rather whimsical and that was a minor distraction, but in the end it works to great effect, adding to the rollercoaster feel of Edith's actual life.Highly recommended.","Shamefully, I knew nothing of Edith Piaf's spectacular life before seeing this film.

1,God. Why did you kill Mary Hanson like that?,"A really excellent and good album. Highly addicting in its beauty. Track three still kills me on the hundreth listen. A good album to start with if you've never heard them. This album marks the beginning of their newer more complicated sound. A lot of drastic changes within the same song and a lot of complex vocal/instrumental harmonies. Most beautiful music I've ever heard. I never met anyone introduced to Stereolab who didn't like them.

1,Amazing and effective,"I've been using this product for over 10 years since I was an acne-ridden teenager. I had very severe acne back then, and now while I've grown out of it for the most part, I still use this product every day to keep things under control. I have very oily skin, so the fact that this product can dry your skin out a bit is a good thing. It reduces pimples overnight if you leave some dabbed on, and makes for a great cover-up during the day. Using regular makeup cover-ups on acne can make it worse by further clogging the pores. Even my brother uses this stuff, so it's not too ""makeup-y"" for a guy. Bottom line: this is highly effective, a bottle lasts a LONG time, good deal for the price, and unlike any other acne product out there.","I've been using this product for over 10 years since I was an acne-ridden teenager.

Bottom line this is highly effective, a bottle lasts a LONG time, good deal for the price, and unlike any other acne product out there."
0,Geertz ignored his presence during genocide for too long,"I have been influenced by the beauty of Geertz writing for decades, but After the Fact has left me disturbed and confused. This summer I read an essay by Stephen Reyna claiming Geertz covered-up genocide in Indonesia, I didn't believe Reyna's claims until I read Geertz's account of these events in this book. Now I don't know what to think, and I am beginning to question Geertz's methods and I want to know why Geertz was not outspoken about the genocide he saw.","I have been influenced by the beauty of Geertz writing for decades, but After the Fact has left me disturbed and confused.

0,For Free Spirits Only,"While Anne Rice's other novels are extremely well written, I cannot say that this series is as articulate. At first I was really disappointed with them, but by the second book, I was asking my boyfriend to bend me over his knee and spank me too. These books opened up a new sexual fantasy realm for me, and I'll admit, I'm not sure I'll ever be satisfied normally again. By the end of the trilogy, I was pretty upset to know that I'll probably never get to experience the slave/master relationship, or such free sexuality like Beauty does in the novels. Changed me forever.","While Anne Rice's other novels are extremely well written, I cannot say that this series is as articulate.

0,*yawn*,"I was extremely disappointed with these books. No character development, scenes are poorly described and these fables lack the lushness in description that I came to expect from the author of ""Witching Hour"". There's plenty of erotica and humiliation here, but as readers we don't empathize with the main character because we don't know her. Had some exposition been provided, examples of Beauty's purity, chasteness and modesty, her downfall into degradation and defilement would have had a much greater impact. The sex scenes are likewise poorly and flatly described, and they are repeated without variation ad nauseum. We never get to hear what Beauty thinks about the humiliation aside from her constant (and ultimately infuriating) whimpering and weeping. There is no gradual transition from haughty noblewoman to debased sex slave. Beauty has been objectified in the worst sense. *YAWN*","I was extremely disappointed with these books.

1,"Very Arousing Fun, But All Erotica, No Story","This trilogy [The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, and Beauty's Release], written under a pseudonym by Anne Rice, is hardcore erotica. It is set in a generic kingdom of medieval Europe. A lovely young princess named Beauty is awakened from curse induced slumber by the kiss of a prince---whom immediately carries her into sexual slavery in his own realm. This story is not as dark as it first seems. The sex is graphic and expands to include a great deal of both female and male gay sex, as well has hetero sex and S & M situations. It is very entertaining, but like hardcore porn, this is little story beyond the endless sex and punishment. Extreme but fun. While this is arousing, it is easy to understand why Ms. Rice chose not to use her real name.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel ""To Be Chosen""","This trilogy The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, and Beauty's Release, written under a pseudonym by Anne Rice, is hardcore erotica.

0,Not Even Comparable to 50 Shades of Gray,"This triolgy was billed as one that 50 Shades fans would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I enjoyed 50 Shades, not for the writing style or the edgy sexual content, but for the excellent character development and compelling love story. The Sleeping Beauty Triliogy is not even comparable.In 50 Shades, the sexual activity was consentual. Not so in Anne Rice's books where young princes and princesses are forced into sexual servitude and exposed on nearly every page to punishment, degradation and humiliation. Those forced to serve are made to crawl naked on all fours through the castle, eat food from plates on the floor like dogs and serve many masters.The books, in my opinion, are repulsive and a total waste of money. If you enjoyed 50 Shades, try a Sylvia Day book next - the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy likely won't be for you.","This triolgy was billed as one that 50 Shades fans would enjoy.

0,Cruelty Is Not Erotic,"I bought these knowing that there would be explicit descriptions of sex, single and multiple partner, gay and straight. I am no prude. I had not read the vampire chronicles. However, I was horrified when the book started with Sleeping Beauty being RAPED awake. I flipped through the rest of the book and found scene after scene of this girl being abused and humiliated. Didn't even bother with the two remaining volumes. Even among S & M couples, there is usually some degree of caring. This stuff is just plain sick and very dangerous in its portrayal of violence towards women.

I read all three in hopes that they would get better. I found out quickly that they did not get better as I progressed. All of the chapters are very repeptative, someone being spanked,abused and or humiliated in some kind of way. There was no explaination as to why Beauty and all the other princes and princesses were made to be so called pleasure slaves. What the ""training"" was for and how it was suppose to make them better. I understand that this was suppose to be a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story but the whole story was implausible.

1,Just a glimmer of what was to come,"Billy Corgan has described 'Gish' as a ""religious album, not in a God way, but in personal way."" Although this may not make much sense at first, songs like 'I Am One', 'Rhinoceros', and 'Snail' confirm this somehow. Their bizarre, almost otherwordly melodies are a pleasure to listen to. Other standout tracks include 'Siva', 'Bury Me', and 'Tristessa' and the fleeting beauty of the strange 'Daydream'. This unsettling but enjoyable ode to Corgan's personality is nowhere near as technically and musically perfect as later albums such as 'Siamese Dream' and 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness', but it has a depth and feeling that was somehow missing.

Anne Tyler never fails to create an alarmingly vivid atmosphere that connects us with every character and ropes us into their lives. I cannot describe the reality of her writng, it is magic. In this story of a dysfuntional family, Tyler slowly builds a plot by giving us a taste of each family members perspective. The story does not focus on teaching lessons or morals but is simply a book telling of a family that could very well be any family and the growing and changing of their characters. It's beauty is that you grow to care deeply for the family throughout the story. You don't read this book, you live it.","I was amazed by Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant's ability to captivate me from beginning to end.

1,Teaches Children to Appreciate Mother Earth,"This book is awesome. I checked it out from the library on a whim and ended up loving it so much that I plan to buy it for my daughter. The beginning of the book provides basic information about the artistic gifts the earth provides for us to use, and then each chapter addresses different materials and creative projects that children can make from them. I've read some bad reviews of this book, and frankly I believe that a person who would feel that way clearly doesn't see the point in instilling in their child a relationship with nature or any sense of organic creativity, but instead tosses them plastic toys and video games and puts them in front of the television. If you want to use a natural approach to art with your children and show them the beauty and value of nature, I recommend this book.","This book is awesome.

1,Dion Doesn't Disappoint !,"Celine Dion has reminded us once again that she is indeed a celebrated Diva of song in the nineties. The title track All The Way, a ""standard duet"" with Sinatra, is definitely worth a listen. However, it is her signature songs such as My Heart Will Go On, Because You Loved Me, and Beauty And The Beast that really showcase her powerful voice and vocal range. This album of songs will undoubtedly be a worthwhile collection for any fans to have .","Celine Dion has reminded us once again that she is indeed a celebrated Diva of song in the nineties.

1,New York City Really Loves Celine,"The reason I did not give her % stars was because there are a lot of songs here that are missing to be a greatest hits collection. Where Does my heart beat now, All By Myself, When I fall in love, and Misled are just a few left out of the collection. Reguardly Celine's songs are timeless, and always remembered. This cd contains the power of love, her first #1, If you asked me to which is a forgotton song that was really loved, Beauty and the beast which i hate lol, Because you loved me, My favorite It's all coming back to me now with her powerful voice and strong piano, upbeat love can move mountains, To love you more with its sighing violins, My heart will go on gag gag, and I'm your angel. It also has 7 new songs including Thats The way it is which everyone knows by now. The other six are good too. Well get this cd cause I never owned a cd by her before this one and I love it.","The reason I did not give her  stars was because there are a lot of songs here that are missing to be a greatest hits collection.

1,Celine the Finest Extract of 90's Pop,"90's music will be remembered by excellent female vocalists such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Celine is a versatile Canadian singer who can sing Broadway musical styled Beauty and Beast rock songs such as All By Myself (Eric Carmen cover) and It's All Coming Back To Me Now (my #1 favorite Celine song) and groovy Because You Loved Me. Personally I would like to hear more of rocky-edged songs but her dynamic vocal appeal is irresistible. Unlike any other compilations this has seven newer tracks including That's The Way It Is featured as single. This latter part of this compilation is somewhat similar in softer tone with latest A New Day Has Come. I am really glad that she came back and will enchant us for sure during this decade as well.","90's music will be remembered by excellent female vocalists such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion.

1,"Captivating, Belinda is work in its own","I found Belinda to be an exceptional work of art. The writing was exquisite as was the storyline. A beautiful story of socially unacceptable love, passion, and fantasies between a beloved middle-aged childrens author, and a sixteen year old run away. It is the story of their undying love for one another, and the misery that befalls them. Once again Anne Rice is captivating and spills over her readers minds with picturistic details and lavish beauty.","I found Belinda to be an exceptional work of art.

1,Much better than the Sleeping beauty trilogy!,"If you were disappointed by the lack of story/plot/character development in Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty Trilogy, Belinda is exactly what you are looking for. It's one of the most erotic books I've ever read, and unlilke the Sleeping Beauty books, the focus is on the story and the characters, and the language is sensual but never pornographic. The mystery element of the story is likewise very compelling, and I had a very hard time putting it down.","If you were disappointed by the lack of storyplotcharacter development in Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty Trilogy, Belinda is exactly what you are looking for.

1,The Sierra Madre Mystique,"Jeff Biggers captures the essence and flavor of the Mother Range by giving readers a first-hand account of living with the Rarámuri (Tarahumara) Indians in this rugged mountain range in western Mexico. But that's not all. We also get fascinating background information with references to older, existing accounts by such luminaries as Schwatka and Lumholtz, B. Traven and Pancho Villa, among others, with whose names and writings I was already familiar from researching this area. The cover captures the vastness and beauty of a place I've longed to visit, and the author information on the back cover alerted me to another book by Biggers that addresses my own neck of the woods in Appalachia, and my own people who lived/live here.","Jeff Biggers captures the essence and flavor of the Mother Range by giving readers a first-hand account of living with the Rarmuri Tarahumara Indians in this rugged mountain range in western Mexico.

0,Sorry to say - I also found it boring.,"I agree with the comments that it's a boring film - no matter how important the subject. And any actress could have played the part that Jolie plays. She just looks sad most of the time. Moves slowly, with a sad look. That's about all the acting that was done on her part, I'd say, except for one emotional scene. (Several people write about her beauty. I don't see that, either. But that's my problem, I guess.) Important subject, but a bad film, I think.

0,The Heroine's Wide Eyed Stares Get Very Annoying!,"I was disappointed with the movie Nothanger Abbey. While I think that Peter Firth is a good actor he unfortunately got stuck acting in a bad movie. My complaints with the movie are the stupid dream scenes, the freaky looking lady with the weird makeup that made her look like a corpse and the weird crescent moon designs on her face and I was also disappointed with the actress who played Catherine. She had the same look on her face to show every kind of emotion. All she did was make these annoing loooks like making her eyes get all big and her mouth drop open into an O shape. Like she had a perpetulal look of wide eyed stares and of looking constantly shocked, startled and surprised. I realize the wide eyed stares were suspoed to show that she was young and innocent but it was annoying and got old fast!","I was disappointed with the movie Nothanger Abbey.

1,"This is an honest, entertaining, crafty book.","Jane McCafferty's ""One Heart"" is a graceful novel, tender yet unflinching in its facing up to difficult motifs. The characters accept the dealer's distribution of cards and play their hands without complaint. McCafferty is a crafty writer who stays out of the way, letting her characters unfold in their own rhythm. She can frame casual looks and construct simple passages that resonate with lessons learned over a lifetime. There is a respect for humans here, with all their inherent sadness and beauty intact, their glitches and their guts, that is hopeful as well as finely tuned. What a pleasure. What a sensibility. I am thankful for Jane McCafferty. Oh, are honest books out of fashion this season? Never mind - read this one anyway.","Jane McCafferty's One Heart is a graceful novel, tender yet unflinching in its facing up to difficult motifs.

0,Great book,"I would give this book five stars! I wasn't able to change the review stars on my kindle. Anyway, I like how Raina in a way has a sort of loyal to both her dad and Gunnar. This book kind of reminds me of Beauty and the Beast, because Belle in the movie is the prisoner sort of and the Beast think he isn't good enough for. Beast falls in love because she calms him and Belle looks beyond to what there is on the outside. I definitely recommend reading this book:]","I would give this book five stars!

1,Good quick book.,"I heard about this book from work of mouth from another med student who is currently doing AIDS research in East Africa. As a soon-to-be medical student and someone who has traveled to some of the places mentioned, I found this book interesting and affirming. He includes some of his opinions about Africa and the nature of his work that made it personal. One small point that I found especially interesting was that he (a plastic surgeon) seems to place reconstructive and ""cosmetic"" surgery (such as elective breast augmentation on a man or breast reduction on a woman with unequally sized breasts) on a somewhat equal plane - as one might expect a plastic surgeon to do. While I don't really agree, his argument was thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book.","I heard about this book from work of mouth from another med student who is currently doing AIDS research in East Africa.

1,ten short stories by Mishima Yukio,"Ten stories by Mishima Yukio; three of which are translated by Edward Seidensticker, two by Ivan Morris, three by Donald Keene, and two by Geoffrey Sargent.Personally, I don't care for Seidensticker's style -- his translations always seem so lifeless -- and reading through his three stories [including the ""Death in Midsummer"" of the title] was nearly torturous. My favorites of this set of short stories were ""The Seven Bridges"" [Keene, trans.] and ""Patriotism"" [Sargent, trans.], a look at the last days of a soldier and his wife.Mishima's stories often lack a traditional plot, focusing instead upon the slow development of a single scene, or on emerging human emotions and motives. Death is a recurring theme in all of his work, and is portrayed with a terrible beauty and admiration.Recommended.","Ten stories by Mishima Yukio three of which are translated by Edward Seidensticker, two by Ivan Morris, three by Donald Keene, and two by Geoffrey Sargent.Personally, I don't care for Seidensticker's style -- his translations always seem so lifeless -- and reading through his three stories including the Death in Midsummer of the title was nearly torturous.

0,an outline that doesn't grow,"Luurie tries for the wide-screen panoramic approach to events/characters, but uses such minute brush-srokes that the total effect is both muted and inconclusive. The characters largely don't connect although they share a vivid physical space. Interior monolgues/motivations don't combine surprisingly or surprisefully. Occasionally there are glompses of the 'old' Alison Lurie (the restaurant scene, but these are few and far between. Reading the book is a bit like watching a wave, it has a power and beauty but it doesn't hold together and it ends up a trickle losing itself on the sand. Perhaps Lurie is saying: life is diffuse and neatness of plot/motivation is an author's con, but without that neatness there is only space and diffuseness, and that's not enough.","Luurie tries for the wide-screen panoramic approach to eventscharacters, but uses such minute brush-srokes that the total effect is both muted and inconclusive.

1,Stunningly melodic power-folk-pop,"NMH's frontman Jaff Magnum sings about sex, nonconformity, inner beauty and..., oh who knows what he's on about anyway? But who cares? On their second album, NMH takes a mostly acoustic starting point and throws in brilliantly crafted pop melodies with fuzzy distortion and an eclectic collage of instruments including trombones, accordions and singing saws. The result is a album in which the powerful acoustic strumming rocks harder than noisy punk numbers (killers though they are), the varied instrumentation is more unique than just about anything out there, and the songwriting is extraordinary. One of the year's best.","NMH's frontman Jaff Magnum sings about sex, nonconformity, inner beauty and..., oh who knows what he's on about anyway? But who cares?

1,Shampoo- ease Tray,"I bought this to do hair at a retirement home. It is a little tricky to use in a shampoo sink because of the cut out for the neck, it would work better in a regular sink. The suction cups are very strong so that helps. I have to adjust the chair ( height and closeness to the sink) for every customer. Keep the water pressure low or it sprays out of the tray. They need to keep their neck against the tray at all times or the water runs down the back, especially if the hairline is low. I would also recommend using a shampoo cape( bought at a beauty supply store)with a towel wrapped around the neck underneath the cape. Even with all that I sometimes end up getting alot of water on the floor. Its not perfect but it does help.","I bought this to do hair at a retirement home.

0,What a letdown,"I was so looking forward to a novel about a Jamaican getaway, especially after having loved my own Jamaica trips. But Stella, who was so creative with home decor, was completely untouched by the beauty of the island and its interesting diverse people. This narcissistic so-and-so went on and on about stinky Rastas and ugly tourists and anyone who didn't happen to have a slim taut youthful physique. She indulged in too much reckless spending, and I felt sorry for poor Winston because I knew he'd rue the day he stepped off that plane in the U.S. and became Stella's midlife-crisis tool. He was much too good for her. Their values were so different, and she was just void of spirituality. Plus the run-on sentences drove so many of us readers crazy! Try reading McMillan's novel MAMA for convincingly 'real' characters that you'd like and would want to know.","I was so looking forward to a novel about a Jamaican getaway, especially after having loved my own Jamaica trips.

1,A Neglected Classic,"First, please understand that Vaughn Williams is my favorite composer. This is not to say that I consider him the greatest composer of all time, or even the greatest English composer. I merely mean that something in his music speaks very strongly to something in me, which leads me to have great affection for his work. That said, I consider this setting of Shakespeare's ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" far superior to any other, including that of Verdi. It is my opinion that the Italian librettist, Boito, did not properly grasp the inner beauty of Shakespeare, and that this did not lead to true sympathy with the material on the part of Verdi himself (Verdi knew no English). On the other hand, Vaughn Williams was certainly one of the most English of musicians.The present recording is a fine one, and by itself gives credence to my views.","First, please understand that Vaughn Williams is my favorite composer.

Her voice and imagination remain at the infantile level and have no other value than spouting gibberish thought patterns.

The work represented in Deer Table Legs is not poetry at all. Where's the use of deep metaphor? The hightened sense of language? Basic common sense? I am not convinced with the author's use of the child-like perspective. Her voice and imagination remain at the infantile level and have no other value than spouting gibberish thought patterns. This book is a great disappointment and not worth the time and money I spent on it.
1,A Beautiful Book,"This was an amazing book by George MacDonald. It was absolutely beautiful and I could not put it down. When I had to put it down, my thoughts were constantly drawn back to the story of Anodos and his journey through the Land of Faerie.As I read, I could see that he was showing me much more than just the skin of the story. There was so much underneath that I could see, like shadows of fish in pond. You can see them, but can't particularly tell what kind they are. Perhaps this is due to lack of intelligence on my part, yet, there was much that I did not understand about the story. Even so, it added to the beauty and mystery of the book.Also, this version by Johannesen is great. The illustrations by Arthur Hughes are perfect to go along with the book.","This was an amazing book by George MacDonald. It was absolutely beautiful and I could not put it down.

1,Great for your kids first big bed,"We were finally ready to move our son to his own room complete with daybed. Our son was still being potty trained so we looked for a way to protect the bed for the inevitable night time accidents from a leaky diaper.This cover is the perfect solution, waterproof but very comfortable to lay on - you don't hear the plastic at all.One recommendation, make sure you let it hang for a day or two to let it air out (leftover factory smell) before using.One last kudo on this is that it's made by Beautyrest so you can buy with confidence.

1,The Album Leaf - Into The Blue Again,"The Album Leaf's post-rock/downtempo mood continues with INTO THE BLUE AGAIN, as ""The Light"" drifts calmly on soft layers of sound. But ""Always for You"" brings in the drums and the vocals, and tracks like ""Shine"" remind you that the Album Leaf is, at heart, a rock band, despite the electronic underpinnings. But that's OK! If it makes ""Red-Eye"" seem like a melancholy stroll through an empty city street with its stuttering rhythm and long strings, that's OK! Really, this is an album that could have appeared on Morr Music. ""See in You"" has that combination of electronic and acoustic guitar that seems all the rage, but does it well; ""Into the Sea"" swells with orchestral beauty; the gentle piano that starts ""Wishful Thinking."" To top it off, ""Broken Arrow"" brings back those weepy strings, and the whole rock/techno dichotomy gets destroyed. But that's OK.","The Album Leaf's post-rockdowntempo mood continues with INTO THE BLUE AGAIN, as The Light drifts calmly on soft layers of sound.

1,A trip to India in good company,"Elizabeth Chater is not the deepest author out there, but her stories always include enough warmth and insight to merit a read. In this particular book, the reader also gets a trip from England to Calcutta and then from Calcutta to the northern reaches of India. I thought the historical details were very good, as well as the insights into how the British military and business people treated each other. Chater throws in a bit of Eastern mysticism and a relatively complex view of Indian life in the 1850s. The only silliness is a heroine who stays too long with a man who doesn't love her while two other worthy suitors wait for her to make up her mind. Otherwise, there's lots of beauty and passion in this picaresque tale. It leaves you wanting more . . . .","Elizabeth Chater is not the deepest author out there, but her stories always include enough warmth and insight to merit a read.

HOWEVER, 2 stars for Roger Vignoles, piano accompanist, for prosaic, dull, bored accompianments that sound like he was sight reading. Two stars for the pamphlet which, while it carries the full texts in the language of the song, just summarize the English translations, even skipping many of the lines! Two stars for the tempos which speed along when Tosti's songs mostly are very reflective and poignent and require attention to detail and to emotion. Finally 3 stars to the choice of selections, 3/4 of which are choice Tosti with 1/4 being less than his best. All in all a great disservice to Dennis' lovely voice and a lost opportunity to hear Tosti's songs being given proper and tender renditions.","Five Stars for Dennis whose singing is exemplary with beauty and understanding and excellent Italian and French.

0,742 pages of disappointment...,"As a current resident of Atlanta, I both loved and hated the detailed description Wolfe gave of my city, its culture and politics. He dug deep to see the beauty and ugliness of my home, which, while often on target, made me uncomfortable at times. That's one reason why I like to read Wolfe's work. BUT, I have to say reading this book was an arduous task. Too much character development, not enough story. I was determined to finish all 742 pages, only to feel cheated at the end, wondering why in the world I wasted my time. My anticipation will surely be tempered for his next piece of work.","As a current resident of Atlanta, I both loved and hated the detailed description Wolfe gave of my city, its culture and politics.

1,Gently Haunted Parlor,"With Parlor we are once again invited into the gently haunted music of Patrick Phelan and his band, Paul Watson, Jim Thomson, and Phil Murphy. Phelan's music is intense and serene; think of the delicate strength the moon uses to pull the tides. Thomson's hand percussion gives life to the bossanova ghosts Phelan's lilting guitar and piano evoke. Watson's cornet and Murphy's lap steel add a yearning, that when coupled with sparse electronic sampling, create the unique sound of two ages embracing. Parlor is a testament to imagination as it collects these diverse beauties into a calm, unified tension; each song stretching inevitably to the next, we are carried through the album. Patrick Phelan is at ease in the beauty of sounds.","With Parlor we are once again invited into the gently haunted music of Patrick Phelan and his band, Paul Watson, Jim Thomson, and Phil Murphy.

1,A Masterpiece of Mystic Poetry,"This is a beautiful book, filled with poems that not only touch the heartstrings, but uplift and expand the spirit.

0,So what was this book supposed to be about?,"This book definitely did not meet my expectations. If there was any humor intended (as the jacket suggested), it was completely missed on me. What I did hear was: whining about the forest service, whining about fat people, whining about Southerners, whining about people who talk a lot, etc. Just count the number of times Mr. Bryson said something nice about someone he mentioned in the book. Go ahead... You're right. If you are not just like him (with that snappy British accent), you are pond scum. When I read a book about the AT I expect to hear about the natural beauty, the adventures, the grueling hike...NOT about how stupid everyone else is and how the author disagrees with every decision the government has made since 1930. A waste of money in my view.","This book definitely did not meet my expectations. If there was any humor intended as the jacket suggested, it was completely missed on me.

College is where you start to put together the skills that you will use to learn for the rest of your life. It is my contention that I have learned more since I earned my Ph.D. than I did before. Feynman demonstrates that as long as you are alive, you are learning. A simple message indeed: enjoy learning.","I am a college professor.

1,Sand in MY boots!,"Reading the ""Deco Dowager"" took me back almost 50 years, It brought back memories of a time of uncertainty, December 1942, with the world at war, there I was 18 years old, taking my military basic training in Miami Beach. The beauty of the Art Deco district somehow detracted from the fact that I was in the army. Having buddies stationed in nearby hotels, including the Edison, coupled with Miami Beach itself, made my training period easy and pleasantly memorable. Reading Dr. Berson's book refreshed my memory of those days. Her story is well written.

Boy am I glad it was that way and not the other way around. Rilo Kiley's earlier work offers an intelligent and quirky view of the world, not blind to the dangers of modern life but still folky optimistic. Unfortunately, on this album the folk-colored glasses fell off. Jenny Lewis's voice has always had a faint little-girl impurity to it, but on this album it's wavered into whiny. This only serves to exaggerate the decline in songwriting; what used to be poetic and complex has fallen to overly simplistic accounts of disappointments. I truly hope that this phenomenal band recovers from their attempts to be ""more adventurous"" and return to the beauty of their roots.","I fell in love with Rilo Kiley by mistake I got my signals crossed, and thought I was ordering this CD when I was really ordering The Execution of All Things.

It seems like forever while I waited to see Kathy Mattea write again and she sure shines in The Inoccent Years and Calling My Name. She really shows that a love song can be done with success in songs such as I have Always Loved You, an Thats The Deal. I cannot stop playing this CD..."

1,Defies lower expectations,"It's a beauty and the beast genre comedy, but the dialogue is above average, even if some of the comedy is lame at best.

1,My kinda of guy!,"I was wondering what ever happened to Steve Forbert, then I heard Dylan's new ""Workingman's Blues"" and I asked myself, where did I hear that tune before? Pretty soon I found myself humming ""Romeo's Tune."" I lost my vinyl of Jackrabbit Slim a long time ago, so I was looking for a collection that would include the best of that album and others that he did. Hailed as the next Bob Dylan in his day, Steve Forbert seemed to be forgotten somewhere along the way, but Romeo's Tune still gets airtime. However, this guy had so much more to offer. In addition to the studio releases, this collection offers live versions of ""Complications,"" ""Thinkin"" and ""Schoolgirl,"" as well as something I had never heard before, ""Samson and Delilah's Beauty Shop.""

0,Disappointed,"I love Tish. I bought this CD at her concert in Westport, CT last week and I am very disappointed with it. Count me among those who don't like the pop sound she creates here. The CD contains a number of songs that she performed in concert--they were beautiful live, but not on the CD. Drums, bass guitar. Who needs it? Certainly not Tish. And aside from that, for some reason her voice doesn't come through with the same clarity and beauty as on her other CDs, and as it does in concert. Experimentation is fine, but to me, this CD's a failure. (But I still love you, Tish.)","I love Tish. I bought this CD at her concert in Westport, CT last week and I am very disappointed with it.

1,Love This Book!,"Having just finished several intense books-Hunger Games series, Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series...I chose this book based on a sample. It seemed like a sweet respite from all of the intensity. It was just what I needed, and more! The writing is great. The character development is perfect. You get to live in Montana and understand it's stark Big Sky beauty, but the real beauty of this book is the absolute courage of its characters and their love for one another. Funny and heartbreaking, mixed with amazingly readable play by play basketball action, this will be a book you recommend and whose characters you will be inspired by and take with you when you're done. Curl up and read this little gem. Bravo!","Having just finished several intense books-Hunger Games series, Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series...I chose this book based on a sample.

1,Great Music! You can't miss out on this one.,"Hercules was a phenominal movie, Ranking with Aladdin, Beauty And The Beast, The Little Mermaid, and The Lion King. This movie's music is just as superb. Michael Bolton lights up the speakers with his electrifying and passionate ""Go The Distance"" single, The Muses are untouchable in their vocal splendor (as well they should be - they are the Greek Goddesses of Music and art), and Hercules himself has a heartfelt solo as well. This movie and its soundtrack is a must have for anyone who is trying to find who they are or where their going, who has ever loved someone dearly, or who has lost a loved one to foul play. Simply Splendid; but be warned: the movie is a tear jerker, and after watching it, listening to the music can have similar effects.","Hercules was a phenominal movie, Ranking with Aladdin, Beauty And The Beast, The Little Mermaid, and The Lion King.

1,Delightful music!,"The movie adaptation of this classic story was done so well by Disney (as if that would be a surprise to those of us that love Disney)...it stands to reason that the music would be fantastic as well. The original scores are so easy to learn and sing...I play this in the car almost daily for my children and we love to sing along. The music is moving to adults, and fun for children. I am sure that some of the concepts are lost on my little ones, but I know that they will come to learn the meaningful message this movie portrays soon enough. Right now they just love Quasi and Esmerelda. Quasi is a lovable character, but certainly not much to look at, which is why I love him so much. It shows that beauty is certainly the most vivid when we view it from within. What a wonderful message to send to our children in this world today, when looks and money seem to matter so much and the virtues mean so little.","The movie adaptation of this classic story was done so well by Disney as if that would be a surprise to those of us that love Disney...it stands to reason that the music would be fantastic as well.

0,Needs an Editor/Producer Desperately!,"Occasionally, one can hear flashes of Tori's undeniable talent in this album. Then, it is washed out by the severe need for an editor. Obvious in the ending of every song on Scarlett's walk, when she used a little vocal swoop to end (and in my opinion, ruin) the songs, it is that much more in evidence here. Tori is in too much love with herself to edit her own songs (or makeup, or clothes, or self-indulgent book, or plastic surgery), and it really shows through.The limited edition of the cd has really beautiful packaging, which alone is worth half the price of the cd.I hope Tori meets and works with a better producer in the future- I think she could make really beautiful music again if someone could just reel her excesses in.Note that her viral marketing team has requested that her fans leave reviews at places (including a direct link to Amazon), and is giving away prizes to those who leave the most reviews. That's pretty crappy all in itself.","Occasionally, one can hear flashes of Tori's undeniable talent in this album. Then, it is washed out by the severe need for an editor.

1,"this stuff works, even for Black people","Something that many people of color know when shopping for personal care products is to pay very close attention to whether or not a particular product works for ""us"" as well. Well this stuff does. I don't think I will realistically ever be able to grow waves again, but using this product at least buys me a few days before my balding spot becomes too noticeable. I also happened to have a prescription for Tretinoin from my dermatologist and read articles online that using the two products together can enhance hair growth. So I use both, only using the Tretinoin in the mornings.This stuff is very runny and will not dry or be absorbed if you have short hair, so I apply it using a cotton ball and then using a dab of Tretinoin.","Something that many people of color know when shopping for personal care products is to pay very close attention to whether or not a particular product works for us as well.

French Quarter: Hot in the City is pure sex intertwined around a feeble plot that only exists as a setup for raunchy sex.

1,Eerie and Satisfying,"Just as the movie leaves you wanting to talk to someone else about their interpretation, the music too leaves much up to you. Calming and discomforting at the same time this soundtrack is the perfect mix to relax to on one of those not so normal days. The melodies and rythms bring back many memories from the film, ideas which are perfectly represented in the music. I highly reccomend this if you enjoyed the movie and want to have one more thing to remember it by. It reminds me greatly of the Thomas Newman score that accompanied American Beauty.","Just as the movie leaves you wanting to talk to someone else about their interpretation, the music too leaves much up to you.

0,"Ok, I guess","This diffuser came nowhere near meeting my expectations. First, although it fits on the Pentax 540 flash, it doesn't exactly fit well. The flash has a rounded edge at the top and the Sto-Fen is straight edged, so it never really fully seats. This is more a cosmetic issue than functional, so I did some testing. The diffuser performed almost exactly as well as the internal diffuser on the flash (which we already own). I couldn't tell the photos apart. Bouncing the flash with the Sto-Fen diffuser created underexposed shots. The only situation where I would get ANY benefit from this device is if I were extremely close to the subject, I didn't want to point the flash directly at the subject, and I was in a location where I could not bounce a flash off a ceiling (like outdoors or some place with cathedral ceilings). So in other words, this product is more or less useless for me.","This diffuser came nowhere near meeting my expectations.

1,Spiritual allegory/sweet romance,"I was fully expecting this book to be a cute little romance and was delightfully surprised soon after beginning it that there are many layers to this novel. Farrington deftly weaves the story of spiritual journey into a simple, yet lovely romance so well that one disinterested in spiritual things would enjoy the tale for its love story, while someone who wants to seek a deeper meaning can find a lot to think about. The beauty of this book is that there is not a lot of the usual relational missteps thrown in simply to complicate the plot. But there is just enough legitimate angst to make it feel real.Although unabashed in his symbolism, particularly in the naming of the characters, Farrington does a great job of posing spiritual questions in an unobtrusive way. I felt as though I could sit and peel away layer after layer and still come up with something new to consider, which makes this a wonderful book for a discussion group.","I was fully expecting this book to be a cute little romance and was delightfully surprised soon after beginning it that there are many layers to this novel. Farrington deftly weaves the story of spiritual journey into a simple, yet lovely romance so well that one disinterested in spiritual things would enjoy the tale for its love story, while someone who wants to seek a deeper meaning can find a lot to think about.

1,Blow your brains out with the King of Instruments,"This CD combines my favorite instrument, the pipe organ, with my favorite modern composer, Philip Glass. This is one of my favorite CD's, and this is coming from someone that loves metal, punk, classic rock, and classical, and can play different instruments for all of those genres. That being said, I can understand how someone that is not familiar with Glass would be turned off by tunes of twenty-plus minutes that are seemingly repititious, but for me the beauty lies in finding the intricacies of polyrhythms, changing time signatures, and building dynamics. Besides that, I love the moods that these tunes create, and in many ways I consider Glass to be a mood setting, ambient composer.I also have to commend Donald Joyce for being able to play through these pieces. His technique and registration choices for the organ would be hard to improve upon.","This CD combines my favorite instrument, the pipe organ, with my favorite modern composer, Philip Glass.

1,Simple yet beautiful,"I give this mobile a 5, it is beautiful and looks nice and was the only mobile my baby had for a few months. But sometimes, and no one seems to bring this up, you just want your baby to be entertained and this mobile just to reiterate does not for all its beauty and simplicity and elegant touch, doesn't provide any music, lights, movement on its own...so if you're willing to dish out some more money for another like we did to put on and take off the crib, do it! IT IS beautiful, but sometimes having something play music that moves will help babies fall asleep, and that is heaven to any parents ears when all you want is sleep!!","I give this mobile a 5, it is beautiful and looks nice and was the only mobile my baby had for a few months.

1,"A masterpiece. Now, if I may elaborate...","This is my favorite DIJ album, too. ""Rose Clouds"" was a good follow-up, but this album is the stronger of the two. From the first warbly strum of ""Death Is The Martyr of Beauty,"" you fall into Douglas P.'s world, decorated in swaztikas and runes, where hope is only spoken of in the past tense.The songs have some variety, but the thrust of the CD is the acoustic guitar and the ""c'mon, just a little closer...sucker"" vocals. ""Little Black Angel"" is a classic, but my personal favorite is ""The Golden Wedding of Sorrow."" It sounds like one of the most cheerful, serene ditties ever. Death in June pulled that trick often. It works.""But, What Ends..."" is the dominant twin of their two ""Apocalyptic folk"" releases. If you like Legendary Pink Dots, Sol Invictus or Current 93, Get This Album. The Brits didn't just have the Beatles to offer.","This is my favorite DIJ album, too. Rose Clouds was a good follow-up, but this album is the stronger of the two.

0,NOT the Snowman soundtrack,"If you're looking for an audio recording of Howard Blake's magical ""Walking in the Air,"" with the appropriate vocals of an English choir-boy, this recording disappoint you. The vocals are adult - soprano and tenor - and are completely lacking in the charm of The Snowman animated film. It's basically been turned into a cheap romance song, a la Disney's adult renditions of Beauty and the Beast, Somewhere Out There, etc. In fact, other than the title track, none of the other tracks are remotely related to The Snowman. The 3-disc set of ""The Snowman"" music cds packages this disc with two others, also completely unrelated to the cartoon.","If you're looking for an audio recording of Howard Blake's magical Walking in the Air, with the appropriate vocals of an English choir-boy, this recording disappoint you.

0,Legend directors cut,"Very disappointing, did not like the director's cut and Jerry Goldsmith's score, I preferred the original Tangerine Dream Score, much more feeling, and brought out the mystical side, darkness and beauty of movie. The new version was too much like Peter Pan, I could not get thru the first part of the movie, without asking why I spent my money on this new version. Sometimes it's better to let things stay the way they are, I would not recommend this version to anyone, especially those who have seen the original.

1,Disturbing but also heartbreaking,"As many other reviewers said, this was hard to watch for me. These children have been robbed of the beauty and wonder of childhood. This type of brainwashing is wrong on such a deep, dark level. It is so scary that this type of thing exists and I see years of therapy in the future of the children that actually escape.I liked that the filmmaker took a neutral stance throughout the documentary, which let the footage speak for itself. And it had a lot of terrifying things to say.","As many other reviewers said, this was hard to watch for me. These children have been robbed of the beauty and wonder of childhood.

1,Extremely informative,"This book has a lot of good information about beauty treatments. I tried some of the recipes for skin care and bath salts and loved them. One thing I really appreciated is that Ms. Berg actually lists specific store-bought products with brand names, what they do, why they work, and which ones are appropriate for which people. That way I can make a more informed decision when I'm at the beauty counter and choose a product that will work well for my specific beauty issues. This book is an easy, fast read, but I keep going back to it as a reference guide. I love it!","This book has a lot of good information about beauty treatments.

This cutter did what I needed it to do and it was similar to the one she had. One of my concerns was what happens when it gets dull? I have had it for 6 months and it is still going strong so I do believe I have gotten my money's worth.","I had gone to a Podiatrist for treatment of a fungus and an ingrown toenail, I noticed that she had a better toenail cutter than you would see at the local 99 cent store or Beauty supply so I tried to find it.

1,Worth it weight in GOLD!!!,"I purchased this after having a hairdresser tell me that I needed deep conditioining treatments to soften my dry, brittle hair - The cost would run me approximately $60.00 - $80.00.I visited my local beauty supply store & decided to give this a try.

No more brittleness, & there was hardly a strand of hair left in my comb.If you have hair that is very dry, damaged from stylers, dyes, etc. Try this product & I'm sure that you won't be dissapointed.Wishing you well.","I purchased this after having a hairdresser tell me that I needed deep conditioining treatments to soften my dry, brittle hair - The cost would run me approximately 60.00 - 80.00.I visited my local beauty supply store  decided to give this a try.

I was already very familiar with the Western texts (the Bible) that Novak ""updated"", and I had a hard time getting over the modern, ""inclusive"" language Novak chose that in my opinion reduced a lot of the majestic beauty of older translations, such as the King James version.Some of Novak's translations ""modernized"" the language to change the meanings of certain passages radically from what was intended.It would also have been nice if Novak had kept the references to the original sources alongside the text rather than buried at the back of the book so that I could easily look up his selections in the language I was more familiar with, but that is a minor complaint.","The concept of this book--a collection of selections from the world's sacred texts, and a companion text to Huston Smith's wonderful The World's Relgions--is great, but I think Novak's execution of it was poor.What bothered me the most about this book was Novak's translations.

0,Good For Doctors - Not for patients,"Beyond Aspirin may be a good book for alternative health care practitioners, but of little use to a patient who wants immediate useful information.

They tell us how great ginger and tumeric are for reducing inflammation, but omit telling us how much fresh ginger or tumeric is useful for tonic or therapeutic dosages, and then tout the wonders of extracts of these plants. Then, they don't tell us what dosages are useful if you get extracts. If there were a companion volume to this book for civilians, it would be a great service to people who would like to experiment with their claims.

Hanging out at Ludington State Park was a good place to inspire reading such a book last weekend.Joan is an excellent writer.

1,"Filmic (yay!), truncated (boo!).","I looked forward to this game with almost pavlovian anticipation, so perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment. In terms of game play (no block puzzles, yay!) and sheer cinematic beauty, I was not at all disappointed. Great story exposition, great vocal talent, great graphics, many many plus points there. Controls took a little getting used to, since they're somewhat different than SR 1, but in the long run I like the SR 2 system better, as it seems to be more versatile and useful -- as well as more intuitive.But the game seemed to cut off a little prematurely at the end -- skinny on the 'net is that there WILL be a SR 3, but I felt a little bit cheated nonetheless. I think if I had it to do over again, I'd wait for a used copy rather than springing for full price; you might consider to do the same.","I looked forward to this game with almost pavlovian anticipation, so perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment.

0,Trite... Clicheed...,"This is the WORST Kathleen Woodiwiss novel yet! Hackneyed and full of cliches, it is a chore to read this book. I do not know why I keep going back to it! Perhaps because I so admire her earlier works, such as ""Wolf and the Dove,"" and ""Shanna."" This book, however, is so mired in the superficial beauty of its characters that no attention is payed to any sense of plot or (God Forbid) believability.

1,A beautiful set and great customer service,"I made more than a hundred searches on the Internet, comparing scores of sets before I chose these. I did not choose them because of the low price, but because of the beauty of the set. Unlike the customer who did not like the sizes of the pieces, I find the pieces to be perfectly proportioned.The tablespoons in the first set that was shipped to me had what appeared to be a machine made scratch across the handles. Almost immediately after I notified them of the problem, Amazon sent me an E-mail informing me that they were shipping a replacement set. Unfortunately, the tablespoons in the replacement set had the same problem--though to a lesser degree. So I sent the tablespoons to Oneida, who sent me flawless tablespoons. I truly appreciate the terrific customer service that I received from both companies and am delighted with my Oneida Strauss flatware.","I made more than a hundred searches on the Internet, comparing scores of sets before I chose these.

0,Singing!! Is that what they are calling this these days,"This is undoubtedly one of the most hideous excuses for singing I have heard of in years. I thought Bocelli was bad, but this kid makes him look like a truly gifted individual. They need to take this mess out of the realms of classical music and give it its' own genre: Schlock. We have become so uneducated about beauty and singing, that we no longer are able to discern either, but only follow like the rats did with the Pied Piper when someone puts something out there for us to hear. There are truly gifted singers in this world who go unheard because they don't have a gimmick. i sang better than this kid when i was 12.","This is undoubtedly one of the most hideous excuses for singing I have heard of in years.

1,"Photographic excellence, and a few, bold, subversive quirks","Each time I look through one of the books by Roy Stuart I am again impressed not only by his creative, original style but also by his highly tuned photographic skills. Look at the artistic skills and perfection behind the work - the lighting, posing, angles, graphics, beauty, comedy, motion, sensuality, eroticism, raw sex - it's all there in each Roy Stuart volume, and even more so in THE FOURTH BODY. Roy Stuart is a genius, and like most great artists, he's got a subversive quirky side which he's bold enough to reveal in many images, in all their artistic and sometimes depraved glory. A society is often defined by the peripheral elements it finds acceptable, and Roy Stuart is not afraid to dance on that periphery, to push the limits, to take the necessary risks that enlarge our horizons. It's inspiring. The FOURTH BODY is a must-have volume. In fact, don't miss any of his other TASCHEN books.","Each time I look through one of the books by Roy Stuart I am again impressed not only by his creative, original style but also by his highly tuned photographic skills.

The title track is one of the Go'Go's greatest singles - a bittersweet lyric and melody, and an incredibly catchy chorus. And there are a few really good tunes here, but mostly they are the downbeat ones ( ""This Old Feeling"" has a great sax solo in the bridge ) but so much here is lightweight pop ( and not in a good way )In other words throwaway, disposable and forgetable. After the hit debut Beauty and the Beat, what these girls needed was a Vacation. They had gone too long with the constant touring and promotional appearances. But what they got was a forced, unprepared entry into the recording studio to strike while the iron was hot, only to find that the fire was burnt completely out.","Sure, this is a fun summery kinda album.

This Is The Night is beautiful and will be sung I am sure, at many weddings from now on. It is a must purchase from Amazon folks!

1,Transcendent Modern Music,"James MacMillan is fast becoming my favorite new composer. These two works are passionate, filled with moments of terror and moments of sublime poetry. Like many composers of the last decades, MacMillan's music is informed by his spirituality, in his case a deep devotion to the Catholic faith. But unlike the holy minimalists, Macmillan is not afraid to embrace the dark and the dissonant, but always with a clear dramatic intent. And there are also moments of almost heart-splitting beauty. The opening lament for the cor anglaise in the World's Ransoming in particular stands out. Though each of these pieces stands on it's own, taken together they are a journey into the darkest moments of the Christian year. If you are looking for a classical version of New Age Spirituality, look elsewhere. But if you want a deep and moving musical and spiritual experience, you can't do better that these works.","James MacMillan is fast becoming my favorite new composer.

0,What??,"In a weekend of watching little known thrillers and ghost stories, we thought this one would be the most suspenseful and well made. Ah, how disappointed we are now. Although the lead actor is a stunning beauty, what the hell was she doing and where was the plot? The film moves too slowly and for the most part was poorly acted. The only believable character was Mr. Laine and he was on the screen for 20 seconds. The sexual undertones (overtones?) did not add the edginess that was required and ended up just being disturbing for disturbing's sake. If empathy was the intent in the abuse references, this movie really missed the mark in a very unsettling way.","In a weekend of watching little known thrillers and ghost stories, we thought this one would be the most suspenseful and well made.

0,"Repin is excellent, Gergiev is not","Repin's performance of these 2 concertos is excellent. He captures the mood and technical difficulties superbly, however, Gergiev tempos are much too fast in the Tchaikovsky, which lessens the beauty of this work and forces Repin to play too fast. I just could not savor the music and the phrasing. Much of the nuances get lost, and it does not add to the drama as you might expect a fast tempo to do. Philips recording has a problem with balance. Repin's violin is much too loud compared to the orchestra which lessens the impact of the crescendos. The Myaskovsky concerto is good, but I would agree with one review that recommended Oistrakh performance (available on Classica D'Oro #9006 or #2010 or Pearl #9295) or get Grubert's performance on Naxos (ASIN: B0000DJEM3). For the Tchaikovsky, I highly recommend the Milstein/Abbado recording on Decca 460619, which captures the phrasing, poetry, beauty and drama of the Tchaikovsky.","Repin's performance of these 2 concertos is excellent.

0,"Slow, long and repetitive","How could this novel be nominated for a Man Booker Prize? I've read lots of books, and some I don't like very much but at least I can appreciate the structure and the beauty in the writing. Not with this one. It didn't produce anything... not a tear, a laugh or a thrill... flat story, flat characters, rainy days, slow, long, repetitive and predictable.","How could this novel be nominated for a Man Booker Prize?

1,"Wonder is childhood, and Morrisey paints it in like","Of all the books in my children's collection, Those illustrated by Morrissey are my favorite. Ship of Dreams is the extention of ""watching for Santa"" and star wonder. The story brings dreams of a child to life and the illustrations are perfectly imagined for it. You'll love it. Story and pictures perfectly combined. Children deserve books equal to the beauty of thier imaginations. This is it.

1,I Love This Product!,"I discovered this product a year or so ago. I love it and wear it everyday. It's really the only ""makeup"" I wear. Lip balm that looks like lip gloss and is healing. I found that sometimes I could not find it locally and was thrilled when I found it at Amazon, by the case.A better price than local, as well. Now I don't have to worry about running out. I wear it everyday, summer and winter. Try it, I think you'll like it.","I discovered this product a year or so ago. I love it and wear it everyday. It's really the only makeup I wear.

1,This really is my church,"I saw them a few weeks ago, playing live at USC 7 (a yearly rave in Seattle), and it was amazing. For the longest time I've been seaching for artists unafraid of chanting, and this is one of them. When I hear this record, it's like being able to hear God. There's so much beauty here, I'd die a happy man if I could just listen to this EP once more. (Also, for all you who are questioning the worth of this EP, it's over 50 mins long, so it's really worth your money)","I saw them a few weeks ago, playing live at USC 7 a yearly rave in Seattle, and it was amazing.

1,A mixture of all fairy tales,"I was in the booksotre looking for a book I had never read, when I found Never After. I had been there the day before and it wasn't there so it was almost like magic. I just got through reading it and I think that it was a very very good book. It was a mixture of Cinderella, Rumpelstilskin, Sleeping Beauty, The Princess and the Pea, and The Frog Prince.

1,Beautiful Film,"Hero is a beautiful and stunning film. The cinematography is outstanding. And just seeing the landscapes of the Chinese countryside are breath-taking.I have to admit for me the story was alittle hard to follow. The subtitles moved alittle to fast in places, and I missed some of it. In certain scenes I may have been looking at the beautifullandscapes and just missed the subtitles. And the same story is told in three different versions so it does not flow continuously.The special effects were also amazing. And these were done in such a way that they added to the beauty of the film.","Hero is a beautiful and stunning film. The cinematography is outstanding.

1,You've got to own this movie,"I went to a private showing of this film with Oakland's Harley Owners Group years ago at the Pizza Hut after a Berkeley theater decided to cancel the showing.This film brings new meaning to the designation ""low budget"". The ""Cycle Sluts"" are a pack of tantalizing beauties who ride hard across the desert on shiny new hogs by day and sleep around a campfire each night. However, in every scene the girls appear as though they have just stepped out of the beauty salon.When the biker women come across a small town and find that the dead are coming back to life,... Sound familiar? This flick doesn't try to hide the fact that it's ""The Wild One"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"". The only way to kill a zombie is by burning it, and just before they burst into flames, the zombies turn to motionless manikins.

1,Simply Amazing!!!,"Peter Jackson did a great job bringing the timeless classic, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, to the big screen. With the exception of a few scenes throughout the three hour film, it delivered with remarkable precision to the novel. I have seen the film 4 times and I don't plan on stopping. I highly suggest that you buy that nine dollar ticket (i know, pricing is getting out of hand) and allow to eyes to witness the greatest beauty that is THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!","Peter Jackson did a great job bringing the timeless classic, Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring, to the big screen.

1,Cute Wintertime Fun,"This Cloe doll is adorable, there is so much attention to detail with the outfits and the doll itself. The makeup is striking and exquisite as well as the beautiful blonde hair. The clothing and accesories are really what make the doll. Between the snowboard, backpacks, earmuffs and fluffy jacket it's the most adorable holiday/winter doll I've ever seen.It's a shame that some reviewers on here chose to sound off about perceived racial bias on the part of dollmakers just because they're offended by a blonde doll, what is the company supposed to do never release a blonde haired doll to keep some predjudiced people appeased? It's sad considering how racially encompassing the Bratz line is.","This Cloe doll is adorable, there is so much attention to detail with the outfits and the doll itself.

1,Lost in the crowd!,"Witty script concerning with a scientist who, through the holography reproduces cloned organs. He is fiercely attacked and supposed dead; since he gets survive and seeks his revenge, behind the shadows as Darkman. Neeson and Mc Dormand are perfect in this underground picture where the love still lives, but the blame wins the combat.Scrupulously detailed this is obviously a Noir Film, conceived as a heartfelt homage to The Beauty and the beast and with some bits of The Opera's Phantom. The awful nightmare in which Preston Westlake lives is unbearable for any human being who briefly assumes his far from enviable situation. Has it any sense to rebuild your life behind the scare that once was a face? .Since its release in 1990 it has his cult followers.","Witty script concerning with a scientist who, through the holography reproduces cloned organs.

1,Great travel iron,"I needed a smaller flat iron to travel with and this fit the bill perfectly! I purchased my first one about 2 years ago and its still going strong and I use it a few times a week and when we travel. My most recent purchase of this product was a gift for my Mother as she really liked it while she was here visiting for a few weeks, she was thrilled with it. I have naturally curly long hair and it takes me a little longer with this iron vs my normal 1.5"" flat iron, but it gets the job done. The price is right on Amazon too- I bought mine at the local beauty supply and paid a few dollars more a couple year ago.","I needed a smaller flat iron to travel with and this fit the bill perfectly!

1,Godlike,"Nothingface's album Audio Guide To Everyday Atrocity is the closest thing to musical perfection ever produced. These guys are the most brutal musicians to ever record and at the same time hold an ethereal beauty to their music. Take ""The Sick"", easily my favorite song on the album, for example. The opening riff is like getting hit with a sledgehammer in the head and it leads way to Matt Holt's angelic voice, too perfect to describe. When he screams the chorus, it sounds like he is being tortured, so catchy though. By the end of the song, I am left emotionally drained.But it is not only this song that rocks. They all are absolutely amazing. From Holt's tortured vocals taking on extremely difficult topics, to Maxwell's dizzying and brutal riffs, to Gall's groove catching bass lines, and Huouck's thundering drums, every moment of Atrocity is pure perfection. Nothingface is the greatest band ever. If you don't own this album and their other two, you haven't lived yet.","Nothingface's album Audio Guide To Everyday Atrocity is the closest thing to musical perfection ever produced.

0,Waste of my time.,"I researched this title on Amazon and then borrowed it from my local library. I'm so relieved that I didn't buy it because it was not at all informative. I was looking for guidance as far as suitable eyeshadow/foundation/concealer for different skin tones as well as instruction on how to to apply them. While the makeup artists did give a tip or two, there was very little instruction or guidance provided. No more than I would have received sitting at a department store makeup counter anyway. The good news is that they used real, attractive woman (as opposed to supermodels with perfect cheekbones and flawless skins).","I researched this title on Amazon and then borrowed it from my local library.

1,"Artistic, beautiful and accurate.","This was the first tarot deck I purchased which I truly felt in tune. I think the secret to this tarot deck specifically is that it utilizes older images and artwork to create unique tarot images, thereby giving the deck the beauty of the Renaissance. The Golden Tarot will invoke the Golden Age of Elizabeth and also some darker imagery which will satisfy any Anglophile, yet there is also images which call upon the mystical traditions of alchemy and Catholic esoterica. You may easily find yourself turning to this deck before you turn to the Rider-Waite deck purely because it is much nicer to look at. The only beef is that the corresponding book doesn't give satisfying descriptions of the cards,but most tarot readers have a small library of books on the tarot that totally make up for it.","This was the first tarot deck I purchased which I truly felt in tune.

0,They should stop here,"I LOVED Candyman 1, I LIKED Candyman 2, but Candyman 3 just didn't grab me. The series here goes direct-to-video and it really hurts the film. It just feels and looks cheaper than the first two. The story also isn't all that special. There just isn't anything new to do with Candyman. Tony Todd does a good job as the title role, by Donna De'errico leaves a bad taste in the mouth and makes the film seem really [inferior]. Whenever a baywatch beauty is featured in movie, it just makes the movie seem poor. Candyman fanatics may find some mild interest int he film, but it is passable. I really hope they end the series here. Part 3 is almost too much and a part 4 would push the series over the edge. But since the franchise is now owned by artisian home entertainenment, they will probably fork out another direct-to-video entry within the next five years. They did it with the Wishmaster series!","I LOVED Candyman 1, I LIKED Candyman 2, but Candyman 3 just didn't grab me. The series here goes direct-to-video and it really hurts the film.

1,Ohhhh yes,"A fabulous product that I used to purchase in London. I am happy to have found it on Amazon. I use it to remove my makeup (waterproof or not). I soak a cotton pad in Bioderma, and then let it sit over the area for about 15 seconds. Everything dissolves away and sticks to the cotton pad. The formulation of this is ingenious, otherwise I do not think that I could justify buying it. Seems like it is just water, but it isn't. I keep this on my vanity table at all times. It makes a great quick brush cleanser (if you need to switch between colors quickly). Will repurchase.","A fabulous product that I used to purchase in London. I am happy to have found it on Amazon.

0,Great straplock - if you don't mind dropping your guitar,"I used to use the Dunlop straplocks exclusively on my guitars - that is, until I went to pick up my Jazz Bass right before a gig, and the upper straplock released from the bass, and I watched in slow motion as the bass fell to the ground with a crash. The bass survived, with minor cosmetic injuries, but after that day, I switched to Schallers and have never looked back.Well, to be honest, I do look back once in a while, because the Schaller's system for attaching the lock to the strap (uses a nut to hold down the strap) comes loose after a while, and requires retightening. But since the Schallers come stock on the nicer Fender guitars anyways, it's what I'm sticking to.","I used to use the Dunlop straplocks exclusively on my guitars - that is, until I went to pick up my Jazz Bass right before a gig, and the upper straplock released from the bass, and I watched in slow motion as the bass fell to the ground with a crash.

1,"Hogg, a wonderfully bizarre & extreme story.","Well, I first heard about Hogg via a friend, during a discussion about the Anne Rice ""Sleeping Beauty Trilogy"". If you thought SBT was extreme, nothing quite prepares you for reading Hogg. I was disgusted with the characters, but felt that he did a good job in portraying their personalities in a very direct and unapologetic way. I was fascinated by the extreme violence and sex, and by how such a story could be told in such graphic detail. It's an excellent example of story telling....but definitely not for the sexually weak of heart or sensitive.","Well, I first heard about Hogg via a friend, during a discussion about the Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.

1,what are you talking about???,"I bought something very similar to this (exactly the same, except without the gameboy and wormlight) and it was a beauty. everything works perfectly, especially the car adapter. I still use it today. I would have reccomended buying it, but now it is outdated and everyone wants an advance or SP. Also, the link cable is a little much. everyone has at least one link cable. I have seven.

1,Excellent Wartime Django,"This is yet another great compilation from the Chronological Classics Series, featuring Django in both big band and the ""new quintet"" format ( with two clarinets ). Django plays wonderfully, and we get to hear some of his most beautiful compositions - Manoir De Mes Reves, Melodie Au Crepuscule among them. The big band writing swings as well. Highly recommended, if only for the breathtaking beauty of Django's ballads.","This is yet another great compilation from the Chronological Classics Series, featuring Django in both big band and the new quintet format  with two clarinets .

1,beautifully told story,"This story unfolds in a simple storytelling style - you can almost hear Prof. Baricco telling it himself as you turn each page. I describe this book to friends as a sort of fairy tale for adults. Like all fairy tales, it has its share of magical beauty and its own moral message for the reader. This novella is a quick read, but one worth savoring.","This story unfolds in a simple storytelling style - you can almost hear Prof. Baricco telling it himself as you turn each page.

0,Boring,"I thought that this was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The whole Sam and Elizabeth fighting is boring and overdone, enough is enough. I'm also dreading a Elizabeth and Sam romance, since that seems where the writer is headed, I would also find that boring. I think that Elizabeth and Tom need to get back together, but I doubt that will happen ever again. This book also focused way too much on Todd and Dana. Again that was boring, they would fight, then makeup, fight then makeup, I think that they need to live apart. Hopefully the rest of the books will get better. Also the whole Jessica and Tristain storyline was lame.","I thought that this was one of the most boring books I've ever read.

1,Kissin's first triumphant recital at Carnegie Hall!,"I was amazed again at how incredible the young Kissin performs under ""live"" conditions. This is a wonderful CD in which the listener is privileged to listen to amazing pianistic virtuosity at its best. Kissin's performance of Liszt's ""Rhapsody Espagnole"" is filled with such passion and beauty that makes one want to visit Spain immediately. The fiendishly difficult Liszt Transcendental Etude no.10 in F#-minor is wonderfully played with such raw power and emotion that forces the listener to hear it again and again. The playful Schumann ""Abegg Variations"" reminds us just how young Kissin was then. This was an amazing CD with one flaw...Kissin's haphazard interpretation of Liszt's beautifully melodic ""Liebestraume."" I must admit I was highly disappointed with this particular performance of Liebestraume;however, the CD as a whole is worth purchasing. Get it now!","I was amazed again at how incredible the young Kissin performs under live conditions.

0,A Great Disappointment,"If you really want to discover the beauty of Piazzolla's music give this disc a miss. There is no substitute for Piazzolla's own albums - especially Tango Zero Hour, La Camorra, The Central Park Concert, etc. Piazzolla loved the guitar, and wrote a considerable amount of guitar music. It's a shame that this album doesn't do justice to Piazzolla's legacy. Guitar afficionado's should check out Baltazar Benitez' beautiful ""Music of Astor Piazzolla"" album instead. Many performers (such as Yo-Yo Ma, Gary Burton, Gidon Kremer, Pablo Zeigler, etc) have interpreted Piazzola much better than Al DiMeola.","If you really want to discover the beauty of Piazzolla's music give this disc a miss.

0,WHEEEERES THE BEAST??,"Hero--tortured, yes. Beast, No--and for that, I was very disappointed. I guess ""beast"" was what the townspeople thought of this unknown, unseen ""dragon"". The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea.","Hero--tortured, yes.

1,Sega GT: another worthy addition to your Dreamcast library,"I'll be honest: I'm not into most racing games because many of them just don't appeal to me for one reason or another, but Sega GT is an exception. The graphics are pretty good, nothing revolutionary here, but very adequate. The game runs very smoothly and luckily, there are no irritating pop-ups, with the backgound and buildings gently coming into view as to not distract too much. The one thing that is great about this game is its use of lighting effects; everything is rendered beautifully and looks gorgeous. However, the one negative is that the controls are a bit sensitive and you have to get used to that, so a lot of practice is needed to truly master the game. The first time I played this game I wasn't all that thrilled because it does have a high learning curve, but then after you really sit down with it, you begin to appreciate its beauty. Sega GT offers a very realistic driving experience that will make you come back for more!","I'll be honest I'm not into most racing games because many of them just don't appeal to me for one reason or another, but Sega GT is an exception.

1,A wonderfull addition to my collection of electronica,"Not being a fan of madonna, but being a huge fan of trance (Oakenfold, Sasha) and electronica (Saint Ettiene) I was skeptical to buy this album.Although I think in some sense Madonna as a persona does not really sell well, the music is superb and grows on you rather quickly. The attempts to be ""sufi"" and ""profound"" are artificial, BUT highly effective, and I think it is the result of her ability to bring out the recognizable and simple beauty of tone from ORBIT, her partner in this CD so that you get elements of electronica that are just pop enough to please everyone. I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone, especially someone who is trying to get their ears accustomed to electronica.","Not being a fan of madonna, but being a huge fan of trance Oakenfold, Sasha and electronica Saint Ettiene I was skeptical to buy this album.Although I think in some sense Madonna as a persona does not really sell well, the music is superb and grows on you rather quickly.

0,The Awful Ending is an Outrage to this Extraordinary Quadriology,"What in the world happend? Did the real person behind the pseudonym ""Lian Hearn"" die after the 3rd book and someone else wrote the Book 4? How could a series that was so incredibly well-imagined and executed go downhill in a such stunning manner? It seems that the author was singularly obsessed with completing Kaeda's curse, i.e. every man who loves her dies. To deliver on this premise, the author flushed the beauty and power of all 4 books down the toilet. I'm positively fuming about this cheap bit of literary sucker punch - there's nothing honorable about how this remarkable series ended in such ignomious and pathetic manner. Had Jato been in my hand, it'll be demanding that Hearn be brought to justice live in front of all the heartbroken readers around the world.Ok.... Ohmmmmm.... [deep breath]... All that said, Otori series is a great read, impossible to put down and unforgettable. God, I'm still so mad about that stupid ending.","What in the world happend?

1,My personal favorite,"I prefer this glove. I play on average 3 times a week. The first one lasted me about a year before the stitching started coming undone and a hole developed in the leather. Very good considering the price, so I bought a few more, in case it gets discontinued or anything. The glove grips the stock grip on my Ektelon O3 Red (The clear rubber tube) very well (and matches!). I've never had any of the little rubber rings on the fingers come off, but they are purely cosmetic. They don't add any extra protection or anything. I just wash mine in the sink with some laundry detergent from time to time.","I prefer this glove. I play on average 3 times a week.

1,Sublime and Thrilling,"From the exquisite opening phrases of Beethoven's ""Adelaide"", David Daniels sings sublimely and thrillingly through all the song groups on his first recital disc.

0,Sorry I bought it,"I have been to Corsica several times and wanted to buy a DVD that captured this island's beauty, but this DVD doesn't do this. First of all, it's like an amateur video that focuses most of the time in Ian Wright and not in the beautiful places that Corsica has to offer. Second, for someone who has never travel to Corsica it would offer no insight into the island. If I had the opportunity I would return it because we didn't even finish looking at it.On the other hand, I also bought and would much better recommend: Corsica: Ile de Beauté which gives you the images you expect in a travel video.","I have been to Corsica several times and wanted to buy a DVD that captured this island's beauty, but this DVD doesn't do this.

1,Better than Bocelli,"As I write this review, J.G. is blasting out of my stereo and I love every note! I am a huge Andrea Bocelli fan, but I think he has met his match in Josh. As many reviewers have stated, I saw him on the Ally McBeal episodes and was entranced, enthralled and intrigued. His performances left me in tears, not only because of the subject matter, but also because of the beauty of his voice. After his Leno appearance, I purchased the CD and have recommended him wholeheartedly to all my friends/family who enjoy this type of music.The strength of his voice and the emotion with which he sings are just outstanding. I do speak Italian and find him an absolute delight to listen to when he sings songs such as ""Alla Luce del Sole"" or ""Un Amore per Sempre"". No matter what the language, however, Josh's presentation is fantastic!Josh is at the beginning of a wonderful career and performs with such maturity for one so young. Looking forward to hearing more from him!!","As I write this review, J.G. is blasting out of my stereo and I love every note! I am a huge Andrea Bocelli fan, but I think he has met his match in Josh.

1,Great little compressor,I have had this compressor a little over a month now. It has been used heavily during a remodel project. It is lite enough to move around which was essential for me. It is one of the quietist small compressors I have been around. You can talk to someone while it is cycling and hear the conversation. It hands down beats any oiless model I've worked with. It has plenty of capacity to handle most all of my needs when it comes to nailers. I have even been using my framing nailer with it. It would not stand up to rapid use with a framer but I do not work that fast as I am usually working alone. I only gave this unit a four star rating because of the packaging. Many of the reviews I read described the packaging as poor and the unit arrived damaged. Well mine was definitely packaged poorly and the plastic motor shroud was cracked. This was purely cosmetic to me and I needed to use the compressor so I didn't bother with it. This is definitely its one downfall.,I have had this compressor a little over a month now.

It is a very personal account of life through the eyes and experience of a highly intellignet, talented and very special druid priestess, who is not ""flaky"" by any means and who has been practising and living her craft for most of her life - certainly more than 10 years. This book transports you to Emma's world - a truly magical place which most of us can only dream of glimpsing. This book is real and inspiring, Emma's language is pure poetry and I feel sad for anybody who cannot see the beauty and passion in her words and who cannot be truly inspired by them.

Druidry is the quest for Awen, divine inspiration ... it is not about new age magical practices.If you are a pagan, buy this book. If you are not a pagan, buy this book!"
0,Streisand's nadir,"Simply the worst Streisand has ever sounded. And the production is equally uninspired. This is the album that has people talking about the vocal decline of Streisand (Although the delightful ""Guilty Pleasures"" shows us that her voice is still a thing of beauty). The choices of songs range from inspired to tired, but there is so little life in the performances. And if we never hear her sing another sappy tune by the Bergmans, that would do just fine. The finale, a ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" type of showstopper, is painful to listen to. In my opinion, Barbra Streisand needs to stop producing her own records and let someone with fresh ideas and a fresh approach reignite her.","Simply the worst Streisand has ever sounded.

1,"Good Price, Nice unit","I bought this product for my bedroom. The unit is fairly quiet. I like the fact that the filters could be cleaned instead of having to buy expensive replacements. I use natural mineral powder makeup, which causes a lot of dust. I used to have to dust all surfaces twice a week. The unit has cut that in half. I'm quite happy with it so far and have even recommended it to co-workers and friends.","I bought this product for my bedroom. The unit is fairly quiet.

1,Great Journal of my pregnancy trip,"I love this little book. I have filled every page with details I do not want to forget. There is enough space to write memories for each week, a space for photos and ultrasounds (you will need to reprint and resize them because it's slightly smaller than a notebook). Also has pages for tracking impressions of doctor appointments and end-of-trimester thoughts. The beauty of it is that YOU write the entire book! It only has guided spaces and a few questions here and there. Room for favorite baby names, baby shower gifts received and at the end has room for childbirth afterthoughts. Overall, a wonderful gift. Make sure it makes it to your preggo by the early weeks/months of her pregnancy as it is a weekly journal that is best filled out as you progress along. Would recommend to a friend and cannot wait to show my baby when he's old enough to appreciate it.","I love this little book. I have filled every page with details I do not want to forget.

1,Well written book on the history of countless of NY ferries.,"Brian Cudahy really did a superb job in compiling and presenting the history of the tremendous fleets of ferries that criss-crossed the rivers and harbor areas of New York. Great work has been done to give readers a current status of the Staten Island Ferry, as well as the Governors Island US Coast Guard ferries. An excellent fleet listing of all the vessels and their operators is included. While a few minor cosmetic changes to the current Staten Island vessels have been made after publication (although no newbuildings have been done yet), this is the most current historical publication of New York ferries. This book is worth reading by any ferry buff","Brian Cudahy really did a superb job in compiling and presenting the history of the tremendous fleets of ferries that criss-crossed the rivers and harbor areas of New York.

1,Fun and useful,"This book is excellent for anyone who has the Latte-Whip. I bought it just for making capucinnos, but it has recipes for everything from lemon butter to tomato sauce and even a few home-made cosmetics. I usually hate cooking, but this helps me make all kinds of new food in minutes.Some of the 'shakes' are a bit ambitious, not nearly as good as what a blender makes, but there's plenty of delicious and very original coffee, cocktail and mocktail recipes. Certainly worth the purchase.","This book is excellent for anyone who has the Latte-Whip.

This is a positively dreadful waste of time and money....I feel sorry for the actors and technicians that had to waste good time producing such rubbish. The story is slightly stolen from the classic ""A Double Life"" starring Ronald Coleman in an Oscar winning role in the 50's. ITs nothing but a lame slasher movie with the addition of famous leads. If you were to bet me that a movie 90 minutes in length and featuring Elizabeth Hurley in all her stunning beauty for nearly every minute of it..and that I'd still regret wasting the time I'd take that bet....I did, and lost.

0,Too Subtle to Be Satisfying,"First off, the volume on this album has to be turned up several notches in order to hear much. Then, the mood doesn't really change. The inflections change, but there isn't a range of emotions. Maybe this is due to too much of a soprano emphasis and lower keys never come bellowing through--the small traces of them just dangle in the background.I understand that the madrigal nature of Madra is not intended to be the same Miranda Sex Garden as seen in later releases like Susperia, Carnival of Souls, or Fairytales of Slavery. But after hearing these delightful albums, Madra is too much of a letdown. For fans of MSG who are considering buying this album, I suggest you listen to samples and decide if it's for you.It does get points for the concept (I admire any artist who visits medieval culture), the beauty in the voices themselves, and the composition. It takes a lot of organization and proper synchronization to accomplish this effect.","First off, the volume on this album has to be turned up several notches in order to hear much.

1,Royo,Length:: 1:12 MinsI am a fan of Luis Royo mainly because I use to buy Heavy Metal magazine. He was often featured on the cover and inside. He has the whole fantasy woman thing down without a doubt. They are beyond beautiful. Even when they seem to be covered in the grime of the world in which they exsist they have that spark of beauty that only Royo can capture. So why only 4 stars you must be asking yourself. Well I have to agree with another reviewer that points out the fact that these images have been cut up and cropped poorly. Why charge so much and not give the fans the whole piece of art work on one whole page? I was so excited to get this to only be let down because it did not meet my expectations. Perhaps they were too high? I do like the book alot but I don't love it like I really wanted too. I've added a video so you can judge for yourself. I'm still glad I have it but I feel like I don't have the best yet.,Length 112 MinsI am a fan of Luis Royo mainly because I use to buy Heavy Metal magazine.

0,A Biased Viewpoint Throughout,"I found this book to be completely offending. As an adoptive mom, I am aware of the issues that my children face as they deal with the loss that is a part of adoption. As the same time, I believe Ms. Verrier is leaving out the beauty and wonder that is adoption and how much being adoption does not encompass EVERY part of life. She leaves adoptees with a ""victim"" status throughout life with no sense of hope through either end of the adoption triad. Many adoptees will be brought down and discouraged by reading this book.","I found this book to be completely offending.

1,Amazing!,"This litle pink sponge is amazing! I didn't know what the hype was all about, but it is worth every penny! You simply dampen the sponge, and it applies your foundation very smoothly & evenly, espcially around the eyes...it's easy to get in the corners. The cleanser is worth it...it really cleans out the sponge of old makeup and keeps it fresh, rinsing with just soap & water didn't do the trick.","This litle pink sponge is amazing!

1,This product is amazing though expensive,"This product does work better than cheaper alternatives - much better. Youtube for use instructions. I do use this but I found a faster way to get a similar effect (with Korean sponges with vibrators, for lack of a better description) so now I use it less. If you don't mind spending some extra time on your makeup than applying foundation by hand (though less than a stippling brush for me), the beautyblender is worth a try. It really makes your makeup look natural but with that extra airbrushed look/glow. When I used this the first time, my husband asked me if I got new makeup and said I was glowing. He rarely ever notices my makeup. If you use foundation and want a natural look that makes you look like you have perfect skin and don't mind spending a little too much on a sponge and a few extra minutes, give it a try.","This product does work better than cheaper alternatives - much better.

1,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I recently purchased this blender sponge and HIGHLY recommend it. I have used other sponges and none compare to this one. It truly blends well and gives the illusion of wearing no makeup at all. It's a worthwhile purchase. I also purchased the cleaner for the sponge which I like as well. It's not sudsy so it doesn't take forever to rinse out. Get them both if you can. Great purchase.,I recently purchased this blender sponge and HIGHLY recommend it.

Too bad, I coudn't return this as it already open and I bought the 2 sponge pack. Still don't know what to do with them.

1,Great Product!,"This truly gives such a wonderful finish. I have many make up brushes to apply foundation with and even with much blending, leaves my skin not as flawless as this beauty blender. I give it four stars because I do wash them after every use and the last time I was cleaning I lightly scratched it to get some extra foundation off and a piece of the actual beauty blender came off. Be extra gentle while cleaning. It is pricey, and it is a great make up tool, but I hope they hold up for a while for the price.","This truly gives such a wonderful finish.

0,I'm sorry but I have to say...,"...that this album is just not a masterpiece. I couldn't help reacting something to all those comments that praise Williams to the skies. Not that I hate him. No. This music is simply overrated. The themes are repetative, the whole scorewriting approach is dull, seems uninspired. James N. Howard or Thomas Newman could have been the ones to be invited to write a music for this movie. John Williams' style of writing seems to be out of date sometimes. This music sounds like as if it had been composed decades ago. You won't possibly be thrilled by the sheer beauty of this score. It simply has almost none.","...that this album is just not a masterpiece. I couldn't help reacting something to all those comments that praise Williams to the skies. Not that I hate him.

0,About As Bad As It Gets,"Having seen Aida on Broadway, I wasn't expecting much from the album: no surprises, only reprises of the same dreck. How this show managed to snag a Tony makes one wonder---just how much did Disney spend on votes? The lyrics are just awful. And the melodies are monotonous. The camp value of the show is lost on me---as is the so-called ""best"" performance of Heather Headley. It's true, she knows how to wail. But it's cliched wailing---all the pop riffs and swoops are there---you can practically predict when they're coming. And Adam Pascal is a terrible actor---every phrase is the same, no nuance, no shading. Not that there's much to interpet in this score. What a mess. You'd have to have tin-ear and zero-taste to appreciate this one. Give me the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast anyday over this fiasco.","Having seen Aida on Broadway, I wasn't expecting much from the album no surprises, only reprises of the same dreck.

1,happliy surprised STILL GOING 2 YEARS LATER,"after reading other reviews, I was hessitant to buy this. Sure glad I did. It works great, is fairly quiet, and meets all expectations for a frig. It maintains the refrigerator compartment at 33 degrees while being set just below the middle of the thermostat.My only complaint are 2 very small dents in the stainless door. This cosmetic flaw was too small to complain about, but did not happen in shipping - the frig was packed with the small dents.Even so, it is still pleasant looking.Overall, very good product. What a great surprise!UPDATE JULY 2011 - constant use for 2 1/2 years. works great. no problems. Just be sure you read the manual and follow instructions about leaving enough air space around the coils to provide adequate ventillation.I know anyone with a frig this good will be pleased.","after reading other reviews, I was hessitant to buy this.

Quite frankly, I was hoping that I would disagree with those who were disappointed in ""Tehanu"".

While I could - perhaps - forgive Le Guin for her decision to tear apart the world she had so beautifully constructed with this rather mundane and heavy-handed tale, I cannot excuse the absence of poetry here; poetry which abounds in each page of the previous three books.Shame on you, Ursula!","Before reading the fourth book in the Earthsea cycle, I was aware of the opinions of many who had already read this book.

1,This Film is Gorgeous,"A family in northern Italy, representing the economic and emotional establishment of the rich world, is disrupted by human passions present everywhere and always. The combination of cinematography and music in almost every scene is crisp, precise, and beautiful in the way of an elegant mathematical proof. Beauty and precision, although clearly reflecting excellence, can nonetheless have a limited appeal, and by themselves do not sum up to gorgeous. But also included is a nice dose of raw, unleashed, and sweaty passion. In concert with the aforementioned qualities, this is quite the mix, and highly recommended.","A family in northern Italy, representing the economic and emotional establishment of the rich world, is disrupted by human passions present everywhere and always.

1,The Quiet Beauty of Shopgirl,"The fact that Steve Martin is an icon in Hollywood and a household name to comedy is enough to make one slightly intrigued with the news that Martin had decided to pursue his literary talent with a small novella entitled Shopgirl. However, contrary to his hollywood début, Shopgirl does not contain laughably loud comedy that pushed Martin to the forefront of Hollywood's best. Yet, Shopgirl is worthy of attention and praise. Because it is a novella, rather than a novel, says something about the book itself. It presents itself with quiet mystery; in which, the main characters appear at first with vagueness while emerging slowly with grace and strength. This is seen in particularily with Mirabelle who grapples with the routines of life and the mysteries of love. Shopgirl's overall subdued beauty gives it a haunting effect that leaves a hunger for more.","The fact that Steve Martin is an icon in Hollywood and a household name to comedy is enough to make one slightly intrigued with the news that Martin had decided to pursue his literary talent with a small novella entitled Shopgirl.

1,HELP! HELP!,"Remember ""Bridges of Madison County?"" and ""Love Story?"". Well, here's another tug on the heartstrings and time out for tears saga. Can a fireman who swore he'd never fall in love find happiness in the arms of a young single woman with a 4 year old son while fighting fires? This love story takes place in a fictional yet realistic small North Carolina town amid nature's beauty and southern hospitality. Nicholas Sparks writes beautiful dialogue and his characters have such depth that like it or not you will be touched by this novel and begin to believe in love stories a-new. No, doubt, a film based on ""The Rescue"" will appear in the very near future. We've already seen Clint Eastwood and Merle Streep. Anyway, Nicholas Sparks ""strikes a match in our hearts again"". He did it with ""Message in a Bottle"", ""The Notebook"", and ""A Walk to Remember"". I liked all of them. His latest ""The Rescue,"" is another readers find.","Remember Bridges of Madison County? and Love Story?. Well, here's another tug on the heartstrings and time out for tears saga.

0,The last disappointment,"I'm a diehard reader of English-based mystery series, and I loved the early Jury novels. I stopped reading when the silly Long Pidd subplots and characters got so much attention. This was my last try with this one. The plot has real potential, but the pacing was lazy and careless.The Trueblood sections went nowhere, and seem to exist to prove the author's sensitivity to beauty. Melrose's involvement seem forced and implausible. The whole effort is blurry and unfocused. Maybe the author is tired of her characters. Carol Ann is now marginal, outdated, a one dimensional character, who does little to advance our understanding of Jury. At the ""shocking"" end I should have cared. I was only annoyed that I had wasted time.","I'm a diehard reader of English-based mystery series, and I loved the early Jury novels.

1,The best I've ever read.,"When I was eight, I read this book for the first time. I read Knee-Deep in Thunder at least twice a year for the next ten years. Then the library closed down and sold off all their books. I don't know where this book went, but I missed it. For two years.Majesty, tragedy, myth, beauty, friendship and the eternal human search for meaning in a world gone mad power this book with an energy that I've never found elsewhere.A cast of bugs, accompanied by two ragtag young people, shouldn't feel as real as this does, but each character somehow rings true. If you have not read this book, you are missings out on a real experience.""How many a man has measured a new passage in his life from the reading of a good book. -Henry David Thoreau","When I was eight, I read this book for the first time.

1,All Over the Map,"I have been collecting strange mysterious female singers such as Lisa Gerrard & Joaane Hogg to name a few, for the last 5 years. I am most pleased to add Mary Fahl to the list. This CD offers some differences then the other 2 female singers who normally stay within a certain mode: wordless Middle Eastern-like & Progressive Celtic Gospel. Mary Fahl seems to be experimenting out of her shell with Arabian ""Ben Aindi Habibi"", Personalized Gospel ""Redemption"", Irish/Celtic earthly songs ""Going Home"", Italian Opera ""Una Futiva Lagrima"", while writing & singing profound songs of her own ""The Great Unknown"" & ""The Other Side of Time"". All are sung with a deep Alto, with at times almost tenor like power, yet still having the grace to hit the normal female beauty. The CD can sound uneven to some, but grows with many listens. I can hardly wait for the next CD.","I have been collecting strange mysterious female singers such as Lisa Gerrard  Joaane Hogg to name a few, for the last 5 years.

1,Like being a fly on the wall overhearing genius at work,"Maybe it's just me, but since I am a creative person I like to understand other people's creative processes and this box set is exactly that clue to what was going on in the mind and behind the scenes of Nirvana. It's almost like a diary. The songs are obviously embryonic, but that's the beauty of the box set, I think. It's not the over-packaged, over-worked, over-polished music that is usually released on CD. It's simplicity is a beautiful thing. Ever wonder what goes on at a practice or recording session? There are clues here as Nirvana just lets loose and plays for the love of the art in some of the improvs.","Maybe it's just me, but since I am a creative person I like to understand other people's creative processes and this box set is exactly that clue to what was going on in the mind and behind the scenes of Nirvana.

It's hard to warm up to a main character who refuses to enjoy the many advantages in her life (beauty, talent, success, wealth, popularity).""Baby Girl"" is the type of person we'd all want to shake in real life. In this book however, people can't stop falling all over themselves to do things for her (unappreciated I might add). I didn't find it especially funny, but the nostalgic sections did appeal and were very well done. Maybe it's a reflection of the author's southern heritage, but did she really have to supply ""Baby Girl"" with a thinly disguised ""mammy""? Would it have hurt the book if her psychiatrist had been tall, thin, Black and beautiful instead of an overweight Black woman who goes way beyond a professional attachment to her patient?","Like many other reviewers, I loved Daisy and expected better from this book.

0,"Great Product, Lousy Seller","This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself. Normally this is a gel that works great and keeps my skin clear. However, I purchased this from BeautyEncounter and it turned liquidy in 2 months. I contacted Murad to see if this was normal and it is not. They told me that it would only turn watery if exposed to extreme heat or cold. I kept the container in my bathroom in the undersink cabinet - thus no extreme heat or cold conditions occurred from my actions. I've had other bottles of this that have lasted 6 months or more without turning into liquid. The seller would not accept returns and made no offer to compensate me for the defective bottle that was sold to me. That said, I will not be purchasing from them again and will make sure to order directly from Murad where an item can be returned for up to 60 days.","This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself.

1,Dark and Satisfying,"Pushing aside any Disneyesque trappings, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" delivers a power struggle between between Beauty as Truth vs. Greed as Evil.

An oblique mention of possible abuse of the Evil Queen as a younger women is interesting without being gratuitous.","Pushing aside any Disneyesque trappings, Snow White and the Huntsman delivers a power struggle between between Beauty as Truth vs. Greed as Evil.

I find myself re-reading it and deriving additional pleasure each time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves the game or think they might.","This beautifully written and well organized book is not a primer.

1,A Brilliant Slice of History,"Tchaikovsky: Ballet Masterpieces, starring Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes, along with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, show us Fonteyn's first amazing partnership in ballet, as well as the foundations of the future Royal Ballet. These excerpts are legendary historical artifacts, and it is so great that those interested in the history of ballet can now access these rare artifacts. Sleeping Beauty particularly appealed to me, especially with Fonteyn's elegance and grace, that was assessable without her having to lift her leg to 300. Of course, her technical proficiency wasn't as excellent as when it was with Nureyev, but it is still quite a sight to see. I recommend this to all fans of ballet, especially as a historical artifact.","Tchaikovsky Ballet Masterpieces, starring Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes, along with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, show us Fonteyn's first amazing partnership in ballet, as well as the foundations of the future Royal Ballet.

The sound is no way near as nice as a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid. It is so noisy that it has a high pitch squeel that resembles a noisy hand drill. The moving parts inside the unit sounds like cheap plasticy grinding gears.

Nicole Whitehead is sexy too, but her scenes aren't as good as some of the other girls. Coleen Marie is rather sexy with good scenes. Tailor James and Stephanie Glasson aren't bad, but they fall far behind Hiromi and Pilar in my book. I never watch any of the other girls besides Hiromi, Pilar, Nicole, Coleen, Tailor and Stephanie. It's not bad to like 6 of 12 Playmates in such videos.

When you sit down to read this book, be prepared to be transported to a different place, far away from all that is known to a magical world of immense beauty and wonder.Helprin has a unique and wonderful gift with the language, and his soaring prose and pristine word pictures help the reader to see and feel a place never before imagined.Set in New York City of a century ago, Helprin's tale calls forth a good man's vision of a glowing city of justice--not as it is, but as it could be. The characters are unforgettable, richly drawn, poignant in their weaknesses and triumphant in their virtues.If you long for an unforgettable experience, and a book you will surely re-read, Winter's Tale is highly recommended.","If there is a Hemingway of our time, it is Mark Helprin.

Stephanie J Block does a fantastic job as Grace, and the rest of the cast is really wonderful too. If you like celtic music or some of the quieter, softer Les Mis songs A heart full of love, Bring him home... There is a very good chance you will fall in love with the music of The Pirate Queen as well."
1,"Ghoulish, terrifying and irresistable!","This fourth album from the original Alice Cooper band probably sent numerous ""peace and love"" hippies running for cover in its day. Despite being eclipsed in the shock department by the works of such current ghouls as Marilyn Manson and Slipknot, KILLER is still a pretty scary listening experience. Many have overlooked the irony of such songs as ""Under My Wheels"", ""Desperado,"" and ""Dead Babies"" and accused Alice of celebrating violence and death. However, that is not the case. A deeper look into the matter reveals that oftentimes Alice's tongue is placed firmly in his makeup streaked cheek. This is a fantastic album full of horror filled and hard rocking tunes, the best of which is ""Halo of Flies"" a tribute to the spy movie genre. It all culminates in the theatrical ""Killer,"" in which Alice gets his comeuppance. Brilliant, bold and downright scary, KILLER is a claasic Alice Cooper album!","This fourth album from the original Alice Cooper band probably sent numerous peace and love hippies running for cover in its day.

1,Beautiful...,"The King's Singers really do deserve all the amazing reviews they get, and this CD is a wonderful example of just what audiences and critics love about the group. The arrangements serve the songs perfectly, and several tracks feature added musicians and two guest soloists, only adding to the beauty that the Singers provide on every track. The liner notes give a nice background essay which serves to put the music in a nice historical context. Each song was also chosen to showcase a specific time or emotion of the night. The CD leaves the listener with a feeling of peace and beauty, making it perfect for a relaxing evening of listening in front of the fire (or on the porch in front of the fan for summer listening). Buy this CD and enjoy.","The King's Singers really do deserve all the amazing reviews they get, and this CD is a wonderful example of just what audiences and critics love about the group.

1,"Beautiful, well crafted, but not without its problems","This passport holder is very well made. The leather is beautiful and has a very soft feel. However, there are two things you should be aware of.First, even though in the product description it states that the fabric inside may not be what is pictured, I was surprised with what I recieved. The material inside my passport holder was plain brown - and while not taking away from the beauty of the product it definitely does not add to it like the fabric in the item description.Second, the size of this passport holder is much larger than the size of a US passport. My passport will fit in any of several pockets, none of which seem to be particularly intended for that purpose.Overall, this is a very nice product. The look and craftsmanship are excellent, but be aware of the above points","This passport holder is very well made. The leather is beautiful and has a very soft feel.

1,Destined to become one of my favorites,"This is one of those rare cd's that after owning for over a year, I still keep it with me constantly. whenever i am at a loss as to what to listen to, thisgoes in. Livingston combines the beauty of his acoustic talents with a never overbearing backup that is a joy to listen to time andtime again. His acoustic talents shine on Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely"" and the romantic ballad ""The More I See You"". His remake of ""I Must Be Doing Something Right"", previously released as a duet with Michael Franks,is far superior to the original. The cd closes with a splendid version of ""Never Can Say Goodbye"". I recommend this cd to any and everybody. It makes a perfect gift for those who have never experienced Livingston'smusic.","This is one of those rare cd's that after owning for over a year, I still keep it with me constantly. whenever i am at a loss as to what to listen to, thisgoes in.

1,Successfully using these clippers on my Persian cat,"I bought these clippers to use on my Persian-Chinchilla cat. She is a long-haired beauty, but gets matted very easily. I tried taking her to a professional groomers to be groomed, but they ran after me in the parking lot right after I dropped her off because they said she was too frantic to sit still!So, I thought, ok, I will enlist my husband's help and trim her myself. We are SO not cat groomers by any means. We used a pretty short blade on her and it worked wonderfully. It took the two of us to hold her down but in the end she got a beautiful trim.I noticed the clippers get a little hot after awhile, only on the on/off button where you hold it with your hand. But in all fairness, I think we took an hour to trim our cat so maybe we overused the clippers past their normal timeframe. I'm happy we got these clippers and now our Persian cat can look trim all the time.","I bought these clippers to use on my Persian-Chinchilla cat.

1,Tweens Teaching Tool,"This book is perfect for kids 9 - 13. It is arranged in chapter stories that each address a tween issue and then analyze the situation using Godly principles (the secrets). I cried at The Secret of Greatness story.....all about wooden people who put stars or dots on each other according to their beauty, charm, etc. The ending is so wonderful! Each story would make a perfect topic lesson for a Bible class with this age group.No one brings God's love to us in our own language like Max Lucado!

0,Not what I expected from such a great artist,"I purchased this album, having already owned his ""Illinois"" and ""Michigan"" albums. My expectations were not met in the slightest. While Sufjan Stevens is hit or miss within his good albums (he experiments, and I dont like some of those experiments), I felt like writing NFG on this CD after I listened to it. [NFG is an engineering term for No F###ing Good] It is an abstract piece of music, no melody, no harmony, no beauty, no meaningful lyrics. Nothing worth listening to, in my opinion. I was heartily disappointed in an artist I am usually praising. Know what you are getting into with this one.","I purchased this album, having already owned his Illinois and Michigan albums.

1,lingering,"I read this book a year ago in bits and pieces while travelling, and I continue to think about it every now and then. This may be the best way to read it; not quite a story with a chronological narrative, the book consists of short sections that trace Lady Sarashina's inner world throughout the span of her life, nearly a millenia ago in ancient Heian Japan. I found it somewhat haunting how she appeared to have lived as if separate from the world, while communicating in her writing a deep sensitivity. For me, the feeling of the book has become almost mythicized, though this effect was not immediate. It takes a while to sink in, to realise its beauty, as do the events in ones lives that become more potent in reflection -- as it is this kind of reflection that Lady Sarashina expresses through her writing, which form the book in itself.","I read this book a year ago in bits and pieces while travelling, and I continue to think about it every now and then.

Veering from the microscopic details of his tawdry life to his grand generalizations to the pompous rejection of Cezanne and ridiculous idolization of Chet Baker, Dave is a crash-test culture dummy.Bravo for courage.

Sybel Leek is not the normal astrologer you find in the living section of the newspaper. She makes it fun, and is uncanny.

0,Annoying Non-Theory,"I picked this book up because it was short and I was drawn to the word ""radical,"" expecting originality in both the content and in the writing. I was disappointed on both counts. Not only is this not a ""radical"" theory, it isn't even new; it's quite banal: give the screenwriter credit. Who could argue with that? But to assert that the screenwriter is the real ""author"" of a film suggests an enormous naivete. So here again is a book written by someone who has never been involved in making a movie; doesn't know the multiple contributions that include the writer, the actors, the directors, the makeup man, the music director, etc. Good writing can justify an unsound book. Not so here. The writing actually intrudes. I don't know what the author's forte is, but it is certainly not film.

What a joy to watch and hear him, as well as Kathyrn Grayson. He was so young, and his weight the best I've ever seen of him. Guess he was born with natural acting talent as well as beauty of voice, because I saw no flaws in his acting--only perfect timing, expression of feeling, and enthusiasm (and, of course, that fabulous voice). A really sweet, romantic movie. Kathryn Grayson also was a favorite of mine at that time--so pretty, with a delightful voice.

1,A necessary book,"This is a quietly terrifying book, one of the best anti-war novels ever written. it's oddly similar to Dante's Inferno, in part of course because the reality of HIroshima the day of and days following are similar to Dante's disturbing vision of hell but also because the narrator walks quietly through the horror and gathers both his own, his family's, and other people's stories. The contrast between the description of beauty and horror give the book much of its power. Much of the beauty is in the glimpses of the agrarian and community life, in the love of family, and some of it is in simple, stunning imagery. Even the explosion itself is gone back to, over and over, in an attempt to get the words right.It's a sobering book, and a necessary one for any student of World War II or of world history. The difference between the country--the land, the community and its traditions--and the state is a distinction that will stay with me.","This is a quietly terrifying book, one of the best anti-war novels ever written. it's oddly similar to Dante's Inferno, in part of course because the reality of HIroshima the day of and days following are similar to Dante's disturbing vision of hell but also because the narrator walks quietly through the horror and gathers both his own, his family's, and other people's stories.

Even the sub-plot of Corso and the green-eyed beauty seemed gratuitous and implausible.","This may be a beach book for intellectuals, but it is certainly not one for the less sophisticated reader who just likes a good read.

1,A quality tale of sword & sorcery,"This is a tale of a young deposed ruler's quest to regain his rightful crown by collecting a rebel army to oppose the evil warlords and wizard who betrayed his father. OK, that's not original, but this is well-executed. The animation is well done in distinctive colors that give it a special beauty, especially the almost pure pastels of the city and palace. Several memoralable characters enliven the tale with crisp dialog and distinctive personalities.The movie sequel, not quite as good, and a direct to video (OVA) followup story are (at this writing) not available on DVD, only VHS.","This is a tale of a young deposed ruler's quest to regain his rightful crown by collecting a rebel army to oppose the evil warlords and wizard who betrayed his father.

1,no allergies or irritation here,"I have had acne issues for more than 40 years - yes, 40 years. I went for a facial a year ago & this product was recommended to me; she said that it would stop the irritation to my skin. AND, IT DID - and I've been using only Dermalogica products since, even their makeup. My acne has seriously calmed down & with no irratation, my skin is greatly more clear. In 40 years, I've tried it all, from precriptions to over the counter - some 25 years ago, Retin A did my skin a world of good ...... now dermalogica products did it again. I don't see me ever trying or buying another brand.","I have had acne issues for more than 40 years - yes, 40 years.

1,Those eyebrows!!,"I loved the episodes. The only thing that bothered me, was the eyebrow penciled in too drastic for Kyra's face. Instead of taking in the script, all I could stare at were those ugly eyebrows. I think the makeup artist got carried away.","I loved the episodes.

1,Definitely Celine's Finest English Album!,"I've been a fan of Celine's ever since I first heard her sing in French over 10 years ago and it's been great to watch her rise to superstar status after learning to speak English. As far as this album goes, I still think it's far and away her best English-language recording. Celine is at ber best here, knocking out emotional ballads that highlight the beauty, power and range of her voice. There's also a nice sprinkling of up-tempo songs like ""Love Can Move Mountains"" but it's the ballads that steal the show. Songs like ""Show Some Emotion"", ""If You Asked Me To"", ""If You Could See Me Now"" and ""With This Tear"" are so beautifully performed that you cannot help to be moved by them. I like her other English albums a lot but this is the only one I can listen to without skipping any tracks...every song is a winner! A must-have for any Celine fan.","I've been a fan of Celine's ever since I first heard her sing in French over 10 years ago and it's been great to watch her rise to superstar status after learning to speak English.

0,not even close...,"I was very let down by this recording. I enjoy Glenn Gould's playing immensely for other composers, but he just doesn't seem to really understand these pieces; Sometimes he gets a phrase or two, but only on the surface. It sounds like he just pours syrup all over the music, without really digging any deeper. He actually brags about how quickly he learned some of the pieces before recording them, only hours before rolling the tape. Music like this requires much more patience and thought to really understand its depth and beauty. I found many of his gestures to be very superficial, and thus distracting and irritating...Listen to Peter Rosel, an artist who really 'gets it'","I was very let down by this recording.

0,Dated and Amateurish Zombies,"I had heard good things about this film but had never seen it. In its day, it had a reputation as being a scary movie. Sadly, it has not aged well and I found it more silly than scary. The acting is quite poor and annoyingly amateurish. The plot is a rehash of Night of the Living Dead. The makeup was probably good for its day, but looks obvious and false now. It's worth a rental if you have enough beer to anesthetize your inner critic. It is not worth buying unless your cousin is in it.","I had heard good things about this film but had never seen it. In its day, it had a reputation as being a scary movie.

0,Much the Same But More Expensive,"Dr. Grayson has made a valiant attempt to put a square peg in a round hole.

1,Miraculous,"The Bach is as modern as in any of today's recordings, despite the age of this one; Lipatti puts as much thought into his interpretation as Gould, but with a result more pleasing to the ear. The Scarlatti is equal in all respects to Horowitz's phenomenal recording, with beautiful colour and impeccable technique at the service of the interpretation. The Mozart leaves one breathless; Lipatti plays each movement in one breath, without respite, with unequalled intensity. Yet the music sounds lyrical, more so than a piano seems capable of. Finally, the Schubert sings like a Lied; One has to go back to Fischer for such beauty. No serious music listener should be without this record.","The Bach is as modern as in any of today's recordings, despite the age of this one Lipatti puts as much thought into his interpretation as Gould, but with a result more pleasing to the ear.

1,A truly captivating collection,"Aphrodisia: Art of the Female Form is a stunning, full-color artbook featuring photographs of sculpture, painting, digital art, and drawing by a wide variety of modern artists. All images were selected from among almost 1200 pieces, by a jury of six people: Joe Chiodo, Spencer Davis, Craig Elliott, Frank Frazetta Jr., Greg Hildebrandt, and Bud Plant. And all artworks have the common theme of celebrating the female form, whether as a fantasy warrior, a ""bad girl"", a far-future femme, or something else entirely. Though Aphrodisia's artworks are emphatically not pornographic, some have an erotic tone, and there are quite a few nude or extremely scantily clad female images. This is an artbook intended for adults, about reveling in the moment of female beauty.

1,Great navigation system for the price!,"I have now bought two of the Tom Tom ones for my son and step-daughter. The beauty of this item is its portability. You can pop it into a pocket or purse and for the most part, the directions are dead on. My step-daughter recently drove from CT to NC without getting lost, which gives me, as a parent, great peace of mind knowing that she will arrive to her destination safe and sound.My son uses the Tom Tom for his work doing pizza delivery. He has noticed that his tips are increasing because of his ability to get to the patron's homes without mishap. Also, when he doesn't need the unit, then his sisters will have access to it. Heck, the price is so good that I just may buy another one for the girls.I highly recommend any of the Tom Tom products. If you want an economical but very excellent GPS, then I would suggest getting the Tom Tom One. If you need a few more bells and whistles, then stay with the Tom Tom product family and purchase a model up.","I have now bought two of the Tom Tom ones for my son and step-daughter.

0,Increased drag and friction; not fragrance free,"Do not buy this product. It is not an effective electric pre-shave solution. This product actually increases drag and friction vs. shaving untreated beard/skin.

I've used this Anthony product after skipping a day shaving and also shaving daily. It does not work. Now, after a few tries, I'm throwing nearly a full bottle of this product away.

0,BAD EVEN FOR A B MOVIE,"I certainly appreciate Tom Savini's skill as a makeup and effects guru, and he's even proven that he can do an ok job with acting as long as it's in a limited role as in ""From Dusk Til Dawn"". But at the same time, Savini seems to be a guy who never saw a script...or perhaps a paycheck...that he didn't like. I'm not sure which movie is worse...this one or ""Zombiegeddon"" but both are putrid beyond all belief. Maybe he was doing a favor for someone, I don't know. The plot concerns some stupidity about a couple of two-bit crooks who owe the mob some money (with Savini as a hit man) and Scream Queen Brinke Stevens as a demoness who transforms into one of the stupidest looking creatures scene on film since the 1950's. Look I know Stevens is a famous ""B"" movie actress and that's fine. But she can't carry a picture and while she still looks good the fact is that she's now over 50 years old and playing parts designed for much younger women.

After the two Americans get over their puritanical feelings they learn that love isn't just sex, it is friendship. If your friendship remains after the love affair is over, then you have found a real love."

1,Drift away on a tropical island,"What a perfect opening to the experience of this cd: the first cut features a dreamy, distant, chanting voice surrounded by a soothingly repetitive electronic progression. Strains of chords ebb and flow throughout. This is far from a spacy, new-agey list of songs. These soothe you and take you far away where the sounds caress your weary psyche. Deliciously blended synth sounds and traditional gamelan bells and chimes create a place where you surrender to their sheer, gossamer beauty. What a cd. Use it for yoga, or while sitting languidly on a hammock in a summer kiss of a breeze.","What a perfect opening to the experience of this cd the first cut features a dreamy, distant, chanting voice surrounded by a soothingly repetitive electronic progression.

0,So unhappy that this wasn't worth watching...,"I've really been in the mood to watch something from the Robin Hood genre, but after about 10 minutes of this (TWICE, I gave it a second try after a couple of months) I was ready to switch to something less annoying (like, Dora the Explorer!) From the lace up boots (and all the other really bad costumes) to the makeup-plastered-on generic wench, just really poorly done.There did seem to be a bit of good repport between Robin and his man servant in the 10 minutes that I did watch, and from that I thought the acting might not be too terrible, but then I saw the fight scene with the wench's father, and I knew what I would have to slog through in order to see the few gems. No thanks...","I've really been in the mood to watch something from the Robin Hood genre, but after about 10 minutes of this TWICE, I gave it a second try after a couple of months I was ready to switch to something less annoying like, Dora the Explorer!

0,Totally disappointing,"I should know better by now than to buy a whole album on the strength of a single song, but apparently it's going to take more hard lessons like this one to really grind that point home for me. I fell in love with Anggun's version of the song ""Snow On The Sahara"" and found myself frustrated by my inability to download it on iTunes, unless I bought the entire album. The only single version they had was a cover by Sarah Brightman, which was great (Hey, it's Sarah Brightman, so it's not like it's gonna suck, right?) but definitely not the same.Finally, I swallowed my pride and forked over the ten bucks, hoping against hope that the rest of the CD would live up to the promise of that song. In brief: it doesn't. The only song on here that even approaches the haunting beauty of ""Snow On The Sahara"" is ""On The Breath Of An Angel"".I definitely regret this purchase. The music just isn't for me.","I should know better by now than to buy a whole album on the strength of a single song, but apparently it's going to take more hard lessons like this one to really grind that point home for me.

1,"Warm, Fast, Fierce... and Funny","A rare and lucky find: sweet, sweet, sweet.I plucked ""Breakfast with Scot"" (one ""t"") from the local library's ""New Books"" shelf. Read it first and then purchased my own copy, the highest praise I can give. That and the fact that I plan to follow up by reading this author's previous works.Michael Downing's characters are as real and loveable as any by Anne Tyler, but without the latter's sometimes contrived zaniness. This last book I remember reading with this much heart and humor is Clyde Edgerton's ""Walking Across Egypt.""Certainly nothing here to offend, and much to praise.It's a bit of an emotional roller-coaster ride, too. I had a tear in my eye at least once and laughed out loud (and I mean LOUD) more than twice.

1,One of the best... greater than or equal to DG?,"For the 2nd Piano Concerto this is the best. Richter crafts his individualistic interpretation that somehow finds further beauty in the score. This performance, by Sviatoslav Richter in 1959, is easily on par with his other recording in the same year with a different conductor for the Deutsche Grammophon label that is already acknowledged as a masterful classic.In fact the two sound almost identical, and I thought they were at first. All you can do is play each version, one beside the other, and pick your favorite moments from each... a slight accent here, a clearer run there--it's a tossup. This recording may be less clear (live?) but has better bass response, which makes a substantial difference in the third movement. I also like a lot of the second movement better here, too.... Richter really stretches out his interpretation and shapes every note.... Sit back and marvel at the vast talent.","For the 2nd Piano Concerto this is the best.

1,The Most Underrated Band in History.,"Well, you've heard a million times the cliché ""still sounds fresh today,"" and I'm here to tell you that this hackneyed saying is absolutely true when it comes to this CD. When I was mostly unfamiliar with punk music I associated the best of it with the otherworldly sound of the introduction to ""The Cutter."" Later, after listening to the album extensively, I realized that ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"" was the worst of the eleven tracks (which is really saying something). It did not take long before they became, like the Smiths, personal favorites. Echo was one of the most original sounding bands of the eighties with talent to burn. They featured the type of complexity that made it tough on critics to reduce that wonderful decade into a stew of big hair, kitsch, and campy lyrics. This is about as passionate a band as there has ever been, and when I play ""Songs..."" I do not jump about. I let it wind through and imbibe its beauty and perfection.","Well, you've heard a million times the clich still sounds fresh today, and I'm here to tell you that this hackneyed saying is absolutely true when it comes to this CD.

1,Amazingly clear writing style - easy to read,"This is actually my favourite book in computer science. John C. Martin has a true gift for writing. The book is a good introduction to the subject for an intelligent but an unexperienced reader. The reason why I like this book is because it is very motivating - the author manages to demonstrate the beauty and elegance of the subject. The only weakness of the book I can think of is that it gives overly detailed explanations of fairly simple ideas. So if you prefer a less watered-down treatment of the subject, then Hopcroft & Ullman is the classic.","This is actually my favourite book in computer science. John C.

1,"Powerful, hypnotic prose","Scientist, romantic, and dreamer, Owi Nandi has set forth an impressive collection of prose in this collection. The beauty, meaning, and vivid imagery expressed in the original German text has been admirably preserved in this English edition. The words land in the mind of the reader with soft explosions, and have that power found in the best poetry, the power to change the mental landscape.Nature lovers will be drawn into the lush descriptions of flowers, trees, and landscapes, which are reminiscent of those depicted in paintings by Georgia O'Keefe or Monet. Throughout the collection, the poems express with startling accuracy the varying natures and phases of relationships, either between people and nature, or between individuals. The blinding white of innocence, vibrant reds and yellows of passion and/or anger, the depthless black of sadness or loss, radiate from the poems. At the end, the reader is left, metaphorically, with a rainbow in his or her mind.","Scientist, romantic, and dreamer, Owi Nandi has set forth an impressive collection of prose in this collection.

It seemed so same-old, same-old; Snape with his greasy hair and malevolent gaze, evil Malfoy, awkward Ron, weeping Hagrid, wise and mysterious Dumbledore, blah blah blah. Nothing really clever or surprising. No character development and little plot. Now I see the beauty in trilogies; enough is enough.

1,One of the most powerful and moving recordings I own.,"The Fairfield Four are a treasure, and I first encountered them on this album, which they released after returning to the studio after several silent decades. As a blues listener, I had always wanted to find a way into African-American gospel music, and this album showed me the direction. From new arrangements of two hundred year old spirituals (""Roll, Jordan, Roll"") to new songs, the group puts to shame most of the treacly gospel music being released today. Here is music that draws on the first original American art form, the African-American spiritual, making it new while retaining its essential beauty.","The Fairfield Four are a treasure, and I first encountered them on this album, which they released after returning to the studio after several silent decades.

This helps you do that. A little tricky to hand clean with a sponge, so if you plan on cleaning by hand maybe get a scrub brush to give it a good working over.","This thing is awesome.

1,Funny quotes from the Nanny,"This book has quotes directly from ""The Nanny"" TV show. Jewels from Fran Fine like ""Big hair makes your hips look smaller"" and ""Far be it from me to rain on anyone's parade - that's my mother's job"". Plus the Nanny on topics like Men, Do I Know Kids or What?, Big Hair and Beauty, the Fine Men, the Fine Women, Ma, the British, herself, and more. There are a couple of cute cartoons and stills from the show. This is laugh-out-loud funny and smaller than a CD, so it is easy to carry anywhere you need a fix of ""The Nanny""!!","This book has quotes directly from The Nanny TV show.

0,pretentious and unoriginal,"This book was very disappointing. I expected a bit more revelations than accepting gray in my hair or ignoring the lines in my face. That scene in the beauty shop was a sham, I felt I was watching a bad sit-com. And how about the writer proclaiming in one section of the book that she had too much money and the next sections she's talking about building a million dollar home on the beach? Talk about contradictions! I could see where the author thought she could bamboozle the public, but what about the editor? I suppose the book is calculated to appeal to wealthy baby boomer women over 50. It didn't work with me -- maybe because I'm too busy working and earning a living! I'm surprized so many women liked it, perhaps the others threw it down in disgust and never bothered to finish it. Definitely a book that's a put-on!","This book was very disappointing.

1,Great value!,If you charge while transmitting there's a buzzing sound. The overall construction is solid on the outside and clunky on the inside. The display is viered at an angle like an old LCD watch from the 80s. This has a cosmetic detriment but for 80 bucks total you expect better quality. The microphone is as good as reviewed and I'm impressed with the ease of use. I would still wait for refinements in the units' construction because it's a matter of time before it falls apart.,If you charge while transmitting there's a buzzing sound.

1,"High quality puzzle, fun to play","We had played many 1000-pieces puzzles and this is the most challenging one. But, it was really fun and the beauty of the completed puzzle was rewarding.Like others had said, the painting features make the solving puzzle an interesting experience. The color was suggesting but confusing too. The odd-shape cutting of the puzzle increases the complexity. I think I had to use the shape of one of the legs of the pieces as a hint in order to place several pieces in.This puzzle would be a puzzle-forever for less advanced players.","We had played many 1000-pieces puzzles and this is the most challenging one.

1,Great PC for an advanced user,"I've already built a few of my own PCs in order to get the speed and capabilities that I want but I've never managed to build one as cheaply as the price I paid for this pre-built beauty. Only minor reconfigurations were needed to adapt this to my specs. The graphics card was an upgrade-must and cost less than $60. I despise McAffee and/or Norton so removing the default AV and pre-loaded/useless software teasers was annoying but now the machine is clean and running exactly what I want. So far it's quiet, fast, reliable and still upgradeable.The Vista needed the SP1 once I got everything up and running but overall I'm impressed by the agility of this PC. I bought it for only $349 (case, keyboard/mouse) and I STILL can't price out building my own using the same specs this one came with at the same price. Plus, I think I bought the last one in stock! Great Deal!","I've already built a few of my own PCs in order to get the speed and capabilities that I want but I've never managed to build one as cheaply as the price I paid for this pre-built beauty.

0,Baby steps to intolerance,"In an era where our teachers and ministers alike are striving ever harder to imbue our children with a sense of the beauty of cultural diversity and concord among the peoples of the world, Johnson and Zacharias' contribution to children's literature is shameful and backward. According to Johnson and Zacharias, being a good Christian means affirming that ""our"" God is not ""their"" God, that modern science is dubious, and that a layman's survey of the bible is sufficient preparation for spiritual independence. Ignoring modern critical scholarship of the bible (but emphasizing inconsistencies in non-Christian texts), the children's version of Jesus Among Other Gods teaches that religious exploration is for clever people like Zacharias but not for those who really want to reflect on the nature of God, salvation and religious observance. That this book should be on any child's bookshelf is a tragedy.","In an era where our teachers and ministers alike are striving ever harder to imbue our children with a sense of the beauty of cultural diversity and concord among the peoples of the world, Johnson and Zacharias' contribution to children's literature is shameful and backward.

1,"A bit of a hassle for nightly use in acne treatment, but worth it!","I bought this for acne control when my tube of prescription Retin-A Micro ran out. Obviously I wasn't expecting for it to work as well as the medication, but after a couple weeks of using it nightly or every other night, I really think it came close! I am no expert on skincare, but my routine was to rinse my face and wear this masque for about 30 minutes at night before bed, and then exfoliate with a generic brand scrub when I woke up the next morning. Since I started doing this I have had consistently clear skin, and I love the way my pores are visibly smaller after using this masque.The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because it is a real pain to get the masque off without missing spots or getting a towel really dirty. This is to be expected with a masque, but other acne medications probably work just as well without putting as much time into it.","I bought this for acne control when my tube of prescription Retin-A Micro ran out.

1,Fantastic journey into the composers mind.,"William Alwyn has captured pure beauty in his music. The Pastoral Fantasia embodies much of what Debussy tried to capture in his music; sunsets, trees, waves, clouds, and all that represents beauty and majesty in the natural world. The quality of this CD is excellent, just make sure you play it loud and with maximum bass capability! It will touch your soul.","William Alwyn has captured pure beauty in his music.

1,Incredible.,"A somewhat inaccessible first listen made me turn away from this album and listen to their later albums instead. On hearing every metaller and his mum telling me how great songs like Demon Of The Fall and When are after repeated listens, i just had to delve back into this album, and boy am I glad. Thunderous roars, riffs and delicate acoustic passages have never sounded so good together.... well actually... no ones tried to put them together like this and succeeded. And therein lies the beauty of this album, the mix of emotions. You have deep-throated growls one second, beautiful almost pink-floydesque vocals the next. Simply breathtaking. Im into some extreme metal and I must admit Mikael's vocals at first were somewat off-putting. Stick with it and you slowly adapt and learn to appreciate it. Just give it a couple spins, you wont be dissapointed. Fav songs : When, Demon Of The Fall, Epilogue.","A somewhat inaccessible first listen made me turn away from this album and listen to their later albums instead.

0,One Good one & One BAD one!,"I bought a new one and a refurbished one, TWICE. The first one was great. The refurbished one had cosmetic damage and would not work. The box it came in obviously had been reused several times. I sent it back to Amazon and reordered another heater. When the second one arrived it was VERY obvious that Amazon had just sent the damaged heater back to me, with different paperwork...in the SAME damaged box. Even UPS said not to accept it and gave me some paperwork stating that it was packaged terribly and had damage. I should have listened. After opening it, I could tell it was the SAME broken heater....it didn't work! SHAME on you Amazon!! I will NOT uy this model, refurbished (NOT)again. The new model worked and is still working great though.","I bought a new one and a refurbished one, TWICE. The first one was great. The refurbished one had cosmetic damage and would not work.

He consistently demonstrates his incredible guitar technique woven amongst his words. There are only a couple of lyric based songs on this disc, but you wish you could hear all the others. The rest is pure instrumental bliss. Anyway...this is decent best-of, but I recommend listening to his entire catalogue. Enjoy. RIP MH.","An incredible instrumental guitarist. An amazing musician.

1,Awesome 5th! Buy it!!!!,"The Performace: The Cleveland Symphony displays their usual excellence - disciplined, accurate, and beauty of sound. Szell's interpretation sounds unique to my ears - very different from Mravinsky and Muti, but no less authentic or beautiful in a layman's opinion.The Sound: This recording was remastered with the new Direct Stream Digital (DSD) technology and Sony's SBM process. The recording has a warm, bassy sound and a wide stereo image. Just a little bit of tape hiss which is natural for a recording this old. Real nice.I hope Szell's Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos get the same remastering treatment one day.","The Performace The Cleveland Symphony displays their usual excellence - disciplined, accurate, and beauty of sound.

0,Seriously misunderstood,"I love ships. I love huge ships. I love everything about the sleek hulks and sultry decks. Clinging to their sides as if they were chubby angels dressed in tons of iron and steel. My father and grandfather and his grandfather have all fallen in love with these baby giants. Married them bought middle class homes in the suburbs of ocean and sea. Popped out little baby barnacles and sent them away to college. I would rather die than live without my huge ship. Stay with her until she dissolves into demita riddled senility. Die hand in hand like some cheesy Nicholas sparks movie.This author obviously doesn't fully appreciate the beauty of large ships and their elegant grace. They shouldn't be avoided like a herpes riddled snooki or the sparkling vampire from twilight, but rather embraced loved and cherished.","I love ships. I love huge ships.

1,You don't have to have sex to be a slut!,"Tanenbaum brilliantly examines how being called a slut has nothing to do with sexual activity. It is the chosen insult of those who see a woman stepping out of her presumed role: be it beauty, culture, dating, etc. A woman can go out on multiple dates and be branded a slut, or can be a virgin who doesn't dress appropriately but is disliked by others and therefore is branded a slut for convenience. Tanenbaum brings in important examples such as the Spur Possee and the Glen Ridge, NJ rape of a mentally retarded girl to explores how assumptions about masculinity and femininity feed this process. When people think calling someone a slut is harmless they are wrong. However, she makes it clear that none of the women who's stories she tells are victims, they triumped!","Tanenbaum brilliantly examines how being called a slut has nothing to do with sexual activity.

1,Air is God.,"...or, at least, Air is Music. Since their endlessly beautiful Moon Safari, Air (along with Zero 7) is the group that produces CDs one can purchase without needing a preview; you can also count on their absolute genius. I bought this CD blindly. And as I suspected, it paid for itself with frissions up the spine from its mere perfection and unrelentling beauty. Even if you don't like the majority of the tracks (although this should only happen if you hate music), than one could buy this CD for Mer du Japon: Best. Song. Ever. Air epitomises their talent in this one track. Can you say ""obsessed""? I can't stop listening to it. I must admit it does have some run-away tracks I'm not a fan of, but on the whole they don't hinder the CD's overall genius. Pure, absolute genius. The CD is rife with genius. No doubt.","...or, at least, Air is Music.

1,Beautiful pictoral essay of historic Mexican inns and hotels,"This book is good, maybe even great, but still can't compare to Melba Levick and Masako Takahashi's AWESOME ""Mexicolor"". Masako's other book, ""Mexican Tiles"" comes close, and still edges out ""Mexicasa"" a little bit as well, so when all is said and done I think I just have to chalk it up to Masako's EVIDENT love and appreciation for the unfathomable beauty of things Mexican. Melba Levick seems to me to see things more from the outside looking in, and without so much PASSION, kind of like a more disinterested spectator than a participant, but that could just be my opinion.That said, this book is is REALLY NICE. I DO really like it and I highly recommend it- especially if you already own and really liked ""Mexicolor"" and ""Mexican Tiles"". Or if you aren't so much into artesanias and Mexican interior design, but are more of an armchair traveler or are interested in actual historic hotels and haciendas.","This book is good, maybe even great, but still can't compare to Melba Levick and Masako Takahashi's AWESOME Mexicolor.

1,Brilliant book. I can't put it down,"When a friend told me about Juliette Kando's Natural Facelift I was a bit suspicious. But I had seen her (my friend's) face improve over the last few months so I sneaked out to the bookshop and bought a copy. You know it really works! And the best thing about it is that you learn a lot more than just looking after your face. Like the author says: it is no use having a good face if you don't carry it well. My droopy jowels have toned up in less than three weeks and I am now working on bigger lips and larger eyes, well, more open and expressive. And because of all the toning exercises most of the fat has dissappeared. Fantastic! Everybody should get this book. Because letting your face go is just as neglectful as letting your body go. Who needs cosmetic surgery? Get Juliette Kando's Natural Facelift instead, it is a lot cheaper and less painful.","When a friend told me about Juliette Kando's Natural Facelift I was a bit suspicious.

1,A Lovely Book for Those Who Appreciate Simplicity and Beauty,"Part of a trilogy, this is a book for those who love the works of Tasha Tudor. Set amongst Swedish immigrant to the rural United States a century ago, it will bring alive all the beautiful traditions and common sense values they brought to this country with themselves.The central character, a young non-swedish girl, learns the beauty of their traditions and how it fits into the America of one hundred years ago. It is heart-warming, without being sentimental or preachy. I, a male, retired Marine Warrant Officer, recommend it heartily.","Part of a trilogy, this is a book for those who love the works of Tasha Tudor.

0,Good design bad construction,"I like the design and how it works. Very comfortable, handy memory card pockets. Also there are clips at the end of the strap so you can quickly remove the strap if the strap gets in your way on a shoot.My problem is the neoprene material is covered by cloth, which after only a few uses is peeling off the neoprene strap. I'm not sure the long term consequences of this. So far it still works fine. I don't know if the cloth is there to give it strength or cosmetic. If it's for strength, then the neoprene may start to rip or come apart.","I like the design and how it works. Very comfortable, handy memory card pockets.

Pete Dexter has an uncanny way of distillingso much into so little...the simplicity of hisnarrative belies the complexity of his charactersand his observations are brutally honest.While his stories are certainly worth telling, thereal beauty of his work is in the world he creates,where life is fundamentally -- and familiarly --unfair.","After reading the fantastic Paris Trout, I feltcertain I would be disappointed by The Paper Boy.Not so.

0,Not that good,"I watched the movie and it was pretty bad. The story line had possiblities, but the acting and makeup was terrible. It was like watching a home made movie, but in this case you actually pay for the rental. It was less than a Grade B movie in my opinion.It's really too bad, the story had alot of possibilities. But, the finished product was horrid, not horror!","I watched the movie and it was pretty bad. The story line had possiblities, but the acting and makeup was terrible.

1,Magnificent,"I'm not an audiofile, but this recording sounds fantastic! I bought this ballet on the strength of the Kirov recording of The Nutcracker which I also thought was brilliant. Presented here is the enitre ballet as Tchaikovasky wrote it on three CD's. Including the fairy-tale segments with Puss in Boots, Little Red Riding Hood and such. The sound is rich and full, filling the room and your heart. It's a bit expensive, but at almost three hours of glorius music how can you complain? Simply put, it's the only recording of Sleeping Beauty you'll ever need, or want.","I'm not an audiofile, but this recording sounds fantastic!

1,A small step back for Opeth,Please read this review with the understanding that Opeth is my favourite band of all time and that I greatly admire Porcupine Tree and Steve Wilson's work as a musician and producer. BUT......... As a huge fan of the brutality as well as the beauty in Still Life i find Blackwater Park a little too watered down for my tastes. The first three songs flow really well and make (along with the title track) the album a 4 stars. Somewhere in the middle it gets very acoustic heavy. And the bonus songs are great but are lacking in the acoustic brilliance that usually is Opeth. Still great but not my favourite.,Please read this review with the understanding that Opeth is my favourite band of all time and that I greatly admire Porcupine Tree and Steve Wilson's work as a musician and producer.

1,Excellent,"This is a fine recording of Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker"". This version is the complete ballet, not just the suite pieces which are more popular. It is great that ""The Sleeping Beauty"" is also on this disc. Many children might recognize some of the themes from this ballet as Disney used them in his ""Sleeping Beauty"" animated feature.","This is a fine recording of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker.

0,Not reliable,"Much like a few other reviewers have noted, the CD player stopping being able to spin up disks after a year or two. We bought two of the previous Sony models which ended up having the same problem. Figured the new version would fix it. Apparently it's new in cosmetic design only. The very same thing happened. Unless you think of these as disposable, stay away. The radio tuner is poor as well. Neither AM or FM stations come in very well and we live right in town.","Much like a few other reviewers have noted, the CD player stopping being able to spin up disks after a year or two.

1,ASTONISHING!,"This 6-song EP serves as a preview of greater things to come ... a sampler, if you will, of the 14-cut album, 'FRIGHTENING BEAUTY.' Thereon, you will also find their fantastic, emotional rendition of the Roxy Music tune, 'While My Heart is Still Beating.' Another favorite is called 'Delicate Anger.' A great message awaits you in the lyrics Xyra has written for the upbeat, jazzy piano-laden piece, backed by Spanish guitar!Unlike the album, the EP climaxes with Nico's song about Jim Morrison, 'You Forgot To Answer' of which Xyra & Verborgen perform a lush but unsettling, Progressive Rock tribute. Elaborate electric guitar, with cello and woodwinds, fly around and through Xyra's soaring voice. The rhythm section rocks, and the keyboards are steadier than those played by John Cale.Xyra's powerful vocals carry most of the songs, and she has written all but two. However, the players take an enormous part in this intensely interesting Progressive Rock and unusual genre experience.","This 6-song EP serves as a preview of greater things to come ... a sampler, if you will, of the 14-cut album, 'FRIGHTENING BEAUTY.'

0,All Beauty - no brawn,"Beautiful european design with brilliant space-saving implementation. How could I resist? I couldn't. I should have. The shots were always good until it started to leak hot water all down the wall and onto my countertop. The steam was always marginal, needing to pause several times during steaming to allow the boiler to recharge. Finally the leaking water and impotent steam forced me to send it in for repair. It has never been the same since. After several weeks it now leaks water worse than ever. The steam is slightly improved but nothing to get excited about. Looking back on the whole experience, I would have to say that the first year was pretty good and then it was down hill ever since. Many a man has been beguiled by beauty that in time fades to remorse and anguish. In the case of the Luna that time frame is about 1 year and the remorse and anguish are in the form of leaking hot water and lackluster froth.","Beautiful european design with brilliant space-saving implementation.

1,AWESOME!,"I've only seen the first few hours of extras so far that come with this set but so far it's been amazing. It's so much fun to learn all about the fun and challenges they had the behind the scenes during those ten years. Smallville is one of the best series ever made and absolutely my favorite ""Superman"" series on TV. Of course, it had its seasons that were less than perfect. However, the wonderful character development and sheer cinematic beauty of this series always remained consistent. Michael Rosenbaum is the perfect Lex Luthor. Allison Mack took Chloe from a one-dimensional ""Lois Lane"" replacement to a complicated, intelligent, witty foil for Clark's serious nature. Plus, there's nothing more fun that watching Tom Welling and Erica Durance portray Clark and Lois as they slowly fall in love with each other. A perfect series!","I've only seen the first few hours of extras so far that come with this set but so far it's been amazing.

0,Put Ashkenazy aside,"Ashkenazy lacks the feeling for Chopin's music. Behind all of his quick fingerwork and clean passages there is nothing. For those of you out there looking for some referance recordings of Chopin I advise you to listen to other pianists such as Rubinstein, Cortot, Gilels, Kapell, Kissin, even Richter (I would be more careful, but damn is the Fourth Ballade sublime) or Rachmaninoff (his recording of the B flat minor Sonata has never been surpassed). These pianists pour much more emotion and beauty into their playing, and their interpretations are backed by a technique that would make Ashkenazy's seem like nothing. Maybe Ashkenazy should quit his table-strumming and just stick to conducting.","Ashkenazy lacks the feeling for Chopin's music. Behind all of his quick fingerwork and clean passages there is nothing.

1,. . . beautiful and haunting . . .,"This is an absolute gorgeous CD, both the lyrics and melodies. The acoustic guitar, violin and cello add incredible beauty.

0,Not the best,"I have had this lap top for a year now. The biggest problem I encountered was almost exactly a year after I got the laptop and the warentee expired. The battery just decided to die. Luckily after numerous calls to Sony they sent me a new battery, but it took three calls. I hope that a new battery isnt needed every year, because that would be just ridiculous. Also i use the laptop a lot, and the left clicker under the touch pad got scratched. The paint is coming off. It looks awful, but thats just a cosmetic problem. Other then those problems this laptop has done its job.","I have had this lap top for a year now.

0,A real disappointment,"We purchased this toy and returned it the next day. I just read a review that said it was a great toy and had to share my story so that people would not be mislead by inaccurate reviews. My daughter really liked this toy until she tried to play with it and it started to fall apart. Almost everything on it that is attached will fall off. We had to adhere 100+ stickers, which unfortunately I took the time to do before we realized what a piece of garbage it was and returned it. The My Little Pony Sweet Shop and Beauty Salon are great, I would encourage anyone to invest in those instead of buying your child such a frustrating and disappointing toy.","We purchased this toy and returned it the next day.

1,Breathtaking,"I saw the author read from her book at my local B&N and I was so impressed -I've never heard an author read so beautifully- that I bought her book. I took it home and finished it last night at 4 in the morning and I had to write a review because this is an absolutely beautiful book filled with richness, texture, people I love and wisdom. What is Wisdom? It is something somebody says that just cuts clean through you to your core, that rings of the truth so loud, that makes you gasp at the beauty. I adore this book and will read whatever Ms. Kimmel writes next.","I saw the author read from her book at my local BN and I was so impressed -I've never heard an author read so beautifully- that I bought her book.

1,"Best ""Carmen"" I have EVER heard...","I first checked this CD out from my local library after seeing the Met's version of the perenially popular opera a couple of years ago. As I listened to the beginning of the Habanera, I heard this astonishingly beautiful voice float through the words. Continuing to listen, I became more and more enchanted with the voice of the wonderful Tatiana Troyanos. The complete recording was one of my best Christmas presents this year! Having listened to several other Troyanos recordings since then, I have come to the conclusion that she is ranked VERY highly on my list of favorite mezzo-sopranos, and that I only hope that if I perform this role, I can bring the same sheer beauty of voice to it that she did. Viva Troyanos!","I first checked this CD out from my local library after seeing the Met's version of the perenially popular opera a couple of years ago.

1,A definite must for those who love Impressionism!,"The paintings throughout the book are reproduced in radiant and superb color, helping one grasp the phenomenal beauty conveyed by the works. The pages are thicker and heavier than most of the art books on the market today. The paintings of the California masters are included as well as some works by lesser known artists. The text is fresh, easy and fun to read, and the chapters are well organized, exploring the origins and evolution of the Impressionistic movement in California. I predict this volume will become a classic.

The only song on here that is good is the first one-""Ex-Girlfriend"". This is a typical No Doubt song with the ska sound firmly in place. Other songs are dreary ballads (""Too Late"" is actually pretty good, though) and pop-like songs more intended for someone like, maybe Alanis Morissette (I could hear Alanis singing ""Bathwater""). The songs ""Magic's In The Makeup"" and ""Simple Kind Of Life"" are the ""feel sorry for me"" lyrics and make the album depressing and somewhat whiny. Gwen Stefani and Co. can find better songs than this. Stick with the first 3 albums if you like No Doubt. I hope their next album goes back to the ska sound.

1,I love this book,"One of my favorite things about this book, besides all the great films that are listed in it, is that it was written by several people, not just one. By having several people give their views on a range of films, it provides a much wider range of movies that you wouldn't get from just one author. I have found that most 1001 must see movie books seem to have a lot of filler, this book does not have that. There are so many great movies listed in this book, not just classics but also great moderns films like Run Lola Run, American Beauty, They shoot horses, don't they? and countless others. I may not agree that every single movie in this book is a must see but the book itself is a must have for anyone who is a movie buff!","One of my favorite things about this book, besides all the great films that are listed in it, is that it was written by several people, not just one.

1,Time Traveling,"This film features Joel McCrea as the great man, and although the story revolves around the effects he had on Stanwyck's character's life, his part is surprisingly small. Brian Donlevy plays a gambler named Steely, a part that resembles Rhett Butler from Gone With the Wind. But the real star of the film is Barbara Stanwyck, whose own strength shines through her character.This story is told in flashback. It revolves around Hanna Sampler's (Stanwyck) involvement with the man who started Hoyt City (McCrea). It is melodramatic with constant twists and turns, but it is done quite well. Stanwyck's old woman makeup is very well done except for the mouth which was too restricting and made her mouth look like Yoda's from Star Wars.The film does not end the way one might expect it to, with the death of the old woman. Instead, there is a satisfying but different end which makes for a better film since it is not predictable.","This film features Joel McCrea as the great man, and although the story revolves around the effects he had on Stanwyck's character's life, his part is surprisingly small.

I found this one used and thought viola!It arrived looking decidedly thrift shop find, a bit like a relic in fact, but I thought oh well- if it works so what? So It wont be winning any snazzy equipment beauty contests.Unfortunately there seems to be some issue with loading the CD's. When I want to change a CD, I have to then spend 15- 20 minutes messing with the door to get it to shut properly so that whatever magic element is inside the changer will load the CD's and play them. To add insult to injury, it also occassionally wobbles and ""sticks"" on one track and the only cure seems to be turning it off and on until it stops doing so. I have no idea if this great ""find"" is going to make it through Christmas before refusing to do any work at all. When it is operational - its great!","This is in part my own fault I suppose.

1,Lovely,This is not the complete book but rather a few selections of St. Augustine's masterpiece. The selections highlight the depth and beauty of his writing and would make for a wonderful introduction to this book for anyone who hasn't read it. It is marvelously illustrated and the art really enhances the work.,This is not the complete book but rather a few selections of St. Augustine's masterpiece.

0,Nothing that hasn't been done before and better,"Paul Gordon's music, like the show as a whole, is a lackluster amalgamation of The Secret Garden, Les Mis, and Beauty and the Beast. The tunes are pleasant enough, but nothing that stands out. The lyrics, however, are cringeworthy. They fail to capture the intricacies of the plot and characters, and they sound ridiculous. I applaud the effort, but you're better off spending money on The Secret Garden, which is similar in style but beautifully written. Jane Eyre is mediocre at best.","Paul Gordon's music, like the show as a whole, is a lackluster amalgamation of The Secret Garden, Les Mis, and Beauty and the Beast.

0,The Most Overated Hair Band,"""Home Sweet Home"" and ""Don't Go Away Mad"" are brilliant pieces that prove that Motley Crue had/has talent. Additionally they are light years ahead of all the other hair bands that littered the airwaves in the 80's however none of their records warrant(sic) a 5 star rating. They did improve when they shed the stupid makeup and machismo posturing and got clean but still the bulk of what they've done is basically simplistic diatribe about strippers/satan/girls with big hair and loads of other crap.

1,Rufus Creates Lush Soundscapes of Beauty,"Rufus Wainwright has released a dazzling debut album, full of lovely warm melodies framed in a landscape of gorgeous piano and orchestral arrangements. Wainwright takes his lyrics of romance and heartbreak, mixes them with drama like little operas and combines music that is part pop, part folk, and part showtune. Listen to the bittersweet opening track ""Foolish Love,"" or the delicate and seductively sweet ""Barcelona,"" Wainwright pours out his heart on both tracks. The song ""April Fools"" rocks along like an old Beatles song with a chorus that is very catchy. The beautiful ""In My Arms"" was produced by Pierre Marchand (Sarah McLachlan). With each listen the songs and his lived-in tenor voice really grow on you. Wainwright has created lush soundscapes of beauty that are tender and bittersweet but made with a lot of heart. This is a great debut effort, and I look forward to his future works.","Rufus Wainwright has released a dazzling debut album, full of lovely warm melodies framed in a landscape of gorgeous piano and orchestral arrangements.

0,Not as good as I expected it to be ...,"I purchased the Zeno Pro at the advice of my dermatologist. He is a believer in the product & thought it would help with my frequent bouts of cystic acne along the jawline. Given that it was recommended by an MD, I had *extremely* high hopes. Unfortunately, the results have been very disappointing. The Zeno has done absolutely nothing to clear my skin. It seems to have no impact whatsoever on my acne, even when used at the first tingle of an outbreak. The best I can say is that after using the Zeno, the pimple is somewhat less swollen, making it easier to conceal with makeup. All in all, though, I would say that this is a pretty expensive product that has given me very little return for my money. I would definitely not recommend it.","I purchased the Zeno Pro at the advice of my dermatologist.

1,Stunning,"Dawn's vocals may take some getting used to at first; when I first heard her, I was reminded of Jon Anderson of Yes. Not good. Then the association died and the beauty took over. A visionary group that has a very unique sound and artistic vision. I've seen them live, the Transit Rider show, and it was amazing and surprisingly funny at points.

1,Captivating Story,"The cast in this story does a credible job in pulling off this story. I liked the casting except for the part of Mr. Thorpe. He did not at all match the beauty of his sister. However, I would have given this product five stars had it not been for the gratuitous sexual overtones in Miss Morland's dream scene and Captain Tilney's one-night stand with Miss Thorpe. These were not necessary and would have saved us the trouble of skipping over these parts each time we view the movie. Mr. Tilney, Miss Morland, Miss Tilney and General Tilney were all portrayed very well. The story is very well done and is entertaining.","The cast in this story does a credible job in pulling off this story. I liked the casting except for the part of Mr. Thorpe.

0,Done with Stylenac,"I have used the Renac for years and loved it. I was no longer able to buy it at the beauty supply, so I ordered on line. It was changed to stylenac, which I was not aware of when I ordered. This looks like the same curling iron, except for the color, but it does not heat enough to curl my hair. I can hold it on my hair for 5 minutes and it barely gets warm. I liked the old one because it was hot and would curl my hair fast. This one heats like a cheap curling iron in the discount stores. The heating element is not the same.","I have used the Renac for years and loved it. I was no longer able to buy it at the beauty supply, so I ordered on line.

The glowing reviews here helped me decide to purchase these earrings and I couldn't have been happier when I received them. The photograph doesn't do them justice.

1,"Simple, functional, practical.","I have been using one of these for about a year, and I love it. It is the best holster I have owned for the following reasons:1) It was cheap. It provides almost the same functionality as a high dollar holster.2) Performance. It really does everything I need a holster to do, that is to say hold the gun until I want it to let go of the gun. The cant is just right for me, and the draw is quick and smooth.3) Versatility. It sits on my waistband as well as a belt holster, but I can remove it with relative ease when I want to. I use it while in the back country, and it doesn't come off while climbing rocks, trees, etc. It can clip onto a wide backpack waist strap as well.The only drawback to this holster is that the muzzle of a full size 1911 protrudes from the bottom of the holster by about 1"". My gun has a few scratches on the front of the slide from rock climbing, but I don't prefer cosmetics to functionality, so I don't mind.","I have been using one of these for about a year, and I love it.

1,Aim For Your Relationship Stars & Reach Them!,"The first thing that struck me about Mapping the Terrain of the Heart was a sense of having come home to a place that really understood and clarified the beauty alongside the struggles of committed relationships. The next thing that struck me was the sense of hope and direction to be able to thrive in a relationship that has flaws as well as fortune. And finally, I was thrilled to learn how to turn anger into empathy, disappointment into clear-eyed forgiveness, and a developing love affair into a lasting committed relationship with happiness and certainty despite the anxieties that come with human love. I have been reading and re-reading and marking up and highlighting and learning from and gifting this book ever since I was given a copy. This book works! And I am convinced it is due to the writers' encouraging belief that each of us has passion, tenderness and the capacity to love, love long, love well, love brilliantly.","The first thing that struck me about Mapping the Terrain of the Heart was a sense of having come home to a place that really understood and clarified the beauty alongside the struggles of committed relationships.

The weight, proportions, paper and typography are something like the experience of the original, or at least, of what the experience of reading was in the time of Colonna. This all helps illuminate the hallucinatory, allegorical text, and for this reader, I felt as if I was inhaling some kind of ether.

Anyway, here's the turn off and let's fast forward to the scene when he told Eliza's cousin(the villain) to leave England permanently and even suggested to settle in France.

Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings.

1,Pete rocks!,"If youve never seen Pete Krebs live, you are missing out on one of the most amazing live musical experiences you will ever have. To me, Pete is a more dynamic musician than the oft-compared-to Elliott Smith, with a down-to-earth friendly smile to warm your heart and ever-a funny quip to accompany the tunes. This CD highlights Pete's beautiful voice, particularly on ""Powderkeg"", and the last track. Such a sweet voice wrenches out my heart and makes me smile inside and out with its honesty and beauty. By far one of the top Pacific Northwest solo artists today. If you like this album, check out his first raw solo album, specifically, the songs ""Suction Cup Hearts"", and ""Shytown"". And never miss a show of his if he's in your town!","If youve never seen Pete Krebs live, you are missing out on one of the most amazing live musical experiences you will ever have. To me, Pete is a more dynamic musician than the oft-compared-to Elliott Smith, with a down-to-earth friendly smile to warm your heart and ever-a funny quip to accompany the tunes.

0,"The tale of a woman wondering ""What could have been?""","As much as I enjoyed this book for its literary beauty and possibilities, I found the story to be depressing and dark. A woman who essentially feels she's wasted her entire life and has a sordid affair with a man young enough to be her son is hardly the story I would recommend to someone looking for a captivating story. I suppose I sound judgemental, but it seems we should be reading spiritually uplifting stories that encourge the sanctity of marriage, not encouraging women to pine for what could have been. The more I write this review, the more I've just decided I really didn't care at all for this book!","As much as I enjoyed this book for its literary beauty and possibilities, I found the story to be depressing and dark.

1,great on-site radio,"i agree with most of the reviews here. the charm of this beauty is that if you have other makita tools with batteries then they will fit this radio. it doesn't charge batteries but why should it? it would be a much bigger unit. by the by - it DOES have an AUX jack (contrary to what other reviewers have said). it is located in the rear compartment where the battery is inserted and is at the top of the compartment. and with the space that that compartment has you could have an MP3 player in there, protected from dust, water etc...","i agree with most of the reviews here. the charm of this beauty is that if you have other makita tools with batteries then they will fit this radio. it doesn't charge batteries but why should it? it would be a much bigger unit. by the by - it DOES have an AUX jack contrary to what other reviewers have said. it is located in the rear compartment where the battery is inserted and is at the top of the compartment. and with the space that that compartment has you could have an MP3 player in there, protected from dust, water etc..."
1,Gorgeous,"Exquisite, sometimes even pretty. Amidst delicate sounds, the lyrics reveal dark painful states and depths of turmoil- achieving a combination of beauty and pain that is surreal. Whatever you want to take from this album, it wont let you down. It sparks an amazing variety of emotions.Each band member's unique talent is unquestionable. Laird's voice while hypnotic at times is coarse and pained when appropriate, displaying the sheer breath of his vocal abilities. Ericah, in lead female vocals never fails to astonish with her enchanting, powerful voice. Together the whole band, in synergy, creates a beauty unsurpassable captivating all drawn to truly unique and poignant dark wave music- especially with a touch of medieval, ethnic and gothic undertones.","Exquisite, sometimes even pretty.

1,Being Caribou,"Having read the book, I was curious to see the movie that had been made at the same time. I would recommend that interested people look at both.The movie doesn't capture the sense of exhaustion and long travel that the book does, but it shows the heartbreaking beauty of the landscape and the wildlife. One element not mentioned in the book is the little toy George Bush who rides along on the trip, his plastic eyes appearing to consider what he sees.In the end, I don't think anything said in the book or shown in the film has any chance to override the wishes of people who have no values other than power and profit. If nothing else, though, the film provides stunning visual documentation of a place that may soon be damaged or even wiped out entirely.","Having read the book, I was curious to see the movie that had been made at the same time.

1,Very Soothing And Fun,"Since I have an African American family, this is the closest Ethnic Bratz doll I could find. But my daughters will play with any kind of Bratz, they are fanatics! I bought this for them in early November, when their report cards came home and they got good marks. They share one, but that's alright, because they don't usually play with it 24/7 at the same times.My daughters undid her ponytails and clips, and now her hair is pretty mangled up, but she can do some really fancy hairdo's when they feel like it. I don't say it's educational, but not every toy has to be. This is one for just relaxing. It's soothing sometimes, to just braid and braid your Bratz's hair until your stresses are gone. It's durable, except for sometimes the hair comes out, and if you leave her makeup on for too long it gets cakey and flakey. I reccomend it four stars.","Since I have an African American family, this is the closest Ethnic Bratz doll I could find. But my daughters will play with any kind of Bratz, they are fanatics!

0,Terrible Waste of Time,"The person who gave it 5 stars either had something to do with the movie or has not seen that many zombie movies because it was just terrible. The acting (what little there was of it) was bad. Characters had almost no reaction to seeing zombie clowns. One guy gets his arm chopped off and just opens his mouth like he is screaming but you hear no sound. It's as if they couldn't afford to pay these people to speak. The few that did speak must have had mic problems because you could barely hear or understand them. The pacing is terrible, the gore is terrible, the editing is terrible. I could go on and on. The zombie makeup was the only decent thing about this movie. The idea behind this movie was good but it was very poorly executed.","The person who gave it 5 stars either had something to do with the movie or has not seen that many zombie movies because it was just terrible.

0,Overindulgence,"This book, like the first, is a gross display of self-indulgence by the author. His desire for a dominatrix does not make good reading for the rest of us. His untouchable perfect beauty fixation is quite disturbing. This book is certainly science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction. The author watched much too much Star Trek; page after page is dedicated tolaborious descriptions of the spaceship's mechanical workings. The problem is that these descriptions are merely techno-babble with no science whatsoever. I regret Amazon's grading system does not allow a zero star score.","This book, like the first, is a gross display of self-indulgence by the author.

1,An Amazing New Recording,"This is not the usual fair of Vivaldi, Marcello, and Telemann. Any student of the oboe will marvel at Mr. Izotov's transcendental technique tossing off many of the selections, especially the Pasculli. The allegretto sounds like two performers. Mr. Izotov's tone is sheer beauty, a solid column from the top of the instrument to the bottom. This is not just a display of technical show pieces but also a performance of elegance. I only hope this is the first recording of more to come from this extremely talented young artist","This is not the usual fair of Vivaldi, Marcello, and Telemann.

Thereby, making you into a beautiful person. The last chapter on prayer and looking for guidance from the Almighty was very good.

1,A National Book Award finalist for 1998--most deservedly.,"My husband, who hates poetry, loved these poems, which have, along with beauty, grace, and concision, the fascination and depth of good short stories. They treat the lives and deepest feelings of ordinary people with sympathy, honesty and a total lack of sentimentality. Sentimental poetry--in which the poet is sentimental about his own sensitivity, the troubles of his time, the evils of the pwerful or even his own evils--is very common and can lead to eloquent lines or, I might say, eloquent lies. A poet who weighs experiences and feelings with care, yet without diminishing their intensity, is less common. I come away from this book admiring the passion and balance of the author as much as I admire his skill as a poet.","My husband, who hates poetry, loved these poems, which have, along with beauty, grace, and concision, the fascination and depth of good short stories.

1,Easy to Install,"The film is easy to install and looks great! It is thick, and gives the impression of a true frosted/texture glass window.Be aware some reviews have noted that though it does block some view from the other side, it does not make for the privacy properties of a true textured window. You'd have to get an actual textured window for that ! :-)But this is a wonderful and changeable cosmetic option to add some privacy that will not block as much light as blinds or shades.","The film is easy to install and looks great!

I believe that was his goal and he accomplished that end brilliantly.It was a healing read and I thank Mr. Foley!","This is an excellent read but not for its factual details about WWII therefore, the 4 stars.Foley is brutally honest as he struggles to surface, and understand, his memories into written words.

I know for a fact that the address was labeled incorrectly (which they swear was correct) because I ordered 3 other hair related products the same day with the same address on all of them and they arrived promptly.

Like folks say, Beauty is skin deep and in the eye of the beholder. One of the things I really love in the movie is when Monique told Tunde that she was a better person for having met him and that she hoped to meet a man just like him; I really liked that.","I really enjoyed this movie because it was so empowering.I am not big but a nice size and I have a daughter that is thick and I found the movie to affirm me and her as well I have heard some negative stuff about this movie and I find that it wasn't what folks was saying about it and I am tired about hearing what folks consider beautiful and what isn't.

1,"Dark, twisted, and funny.","This is a surreal, and compelling novel about among other things - redemption through violence. Like the Amazon reviewer I found it a little disturbing but no more so than Cormac McCarthy or J G Ballard. The humor is dry and the tone is one of obvious irony. There are passages of great lyricism and beauty but lovers of Irish fiction beware: Maeve Binchy it isn't","This is a surreal, and compelling novel about among other things - redemption through violence.

0,Not enough math!,"The DVD has more focus on dancing and singing than math. The children in the video have so much makeup on ... why would elementary kids wear makeup? The included musical CD is a bit better, with more math problems. The music on both is ok and the dancing is cute, if only the addition and subtraction were the main focus.","The DVD has more focus on dancing and singing than math.

1,Shark Liver Oil?,"This has a light, viscous texture and absorbs super easily...which is the point. Use is with my vitamin c and other serums for greater absorption. This stuff really is awesome and you get a pretty significant amount for a relatively small number of pesos.Is it really shark oil? The bottle doesn't call out from where they derive the squalane. Shark liver oil is one source but so are olives...I prefer not to imagine little sharks with organ donor cards, making the ultimate sacrifice for my beauty products.I like this far better than argon oil...for my skin anyway. I have never used it on my hair and still enjoy the argon oil for that.","This has a light, viscous texture and absorbs super easily...which is the point.

0,Sissel's American debut is rather lackluster!,"Sissel's classically trained voice is wasted on this set of bargain basement songs. Hailing from Norway, Sissel is best known for those ubiquitous ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" in the blockbuster movie 'Titanic's' score. On this, her stateside debut, various Scandanavian songwriters provided a whole album full of just about every lyrical cliche and banality in existence. ""When your fingers touch my skin."" ""I'm all alone in the rainfall.""The production is so flat and charmless that you might be left wondering whether you're actually listening to a collection of hastily assembled demos. Sissel has obvious talent and beauty, but is urgently in need of some fresher, more melodic material and a much more competent producer. Avoid this one!","Sissel's classically trained voice is wasted on this set of bargain basement songs.

1,Love this bag!,Wife and I were looking for a more cozy experience for our camping trips. We loved the idea of a double sleeping bag. The beauty of this bag is you can have 2 singles or one double. It was big enough for us and our 3 year old. Was almost too warm for the lower 50 degree temps. Pillows were a bit flimsy but did ok. Very comfortable and was shipped quickly! Recommend it.,Wife and I were looking for a more cozy experience for our camping trips. We loved the idea of a double sleeping bag. The beauty of this bag is you can have 2 singles or one double.

1,Beautifully Simplistic...,"I love this band! Song after song emit such sweet lyrics and chills up and down your spine. Birds of My Neighborhood is a step slower than Glow, but, a perfect sampling of the softest, most angelic voice in the music industry. I've been searching for an equal of my favorite IM song ""Brave"" off the Glow CD, and I've almost met a match with ""The Lakes of Canada"" and ""I Haven't Seen This Day Before"".

0,Don't bother,"I'm a big Bacharach fan, but Hal David's lyrics were too essential to the beauty and success of these songs to be left out, and most of these versions are just instrumentals. These songs sung by the artists who made them hits would be a great collection. Otherwise, I'd prefer covers by artists with more contemporary interpretations. Who wants to listen to cheesy, 70's arrangements with no vocals or lyrics?

0,This is so cheap,Nice meditation. That is about it. This is probably the lousiest Reiki attunement one can possibly get. I did not feel anything. Why not get a real Reikimaster teacher to attune you in person. Also it is totally foolish to think you can become a Reikimaster from a CD. I don't see how Murray does other than exploit and debilitate the beauty of Reiki this way.,Nice meditation. That is about it. This is probably the lousiest Reiki attunement one can possibly get.

1,Great repair for dry skin,"This is the best moisture cream that will ease all dryness of your skin. use it at night or under your makeup and it will not feels too oily at all. It comes with a smaller package, 1.7 oz and does not last very long if you use it daily. I use it everyday at night and also during winter under makeup. The salon size is not too huge at all, feels like any cleaner size you get from stores, and more it's more economical try it!","This is the best moisture cream that will ease all dryness of your skin. use it at night or under your makeup and it will not feels too oily at all.

0,Self-Hatred Personified,"I feel sorry for Debra Dickerson. I looked forward to reading the story of an accomplished African-American woman who grew up in the same era as I. What I found was the clearest example of self-hatred that I have ever read. From her writing style with her use of words as a weapon to batter those deemed less worthy than she (which seems to include every Black person walking) to her abuse of alcohol, she experiences a self-made isolation because no one is good enough. She defines self-inflicted racism.I found her story completely uninteresting with the exception of when she wrote about her brother, Bobby. I pity Debra Dickerson. There is so much value to be gained from interaction with others whether or not we share the same backgrounds and beliefs. Ms. Dickerson is far too self-involved to appreciate the beauty and spirit of her black heritage.","I feel sorry for Debra Dickerson.

1,An Awesome Musical Collection,"This CD is my all time favorite collection of classical music and wedding music. I myself am only 21 but I have played the violin for 17 years and am simply blown away by the sound quality and the beauty each song possesses. My favorites are Canon in D and Ave Maria, and I can not help but close my eyes and simply get lost in this music.","This CD is my all time favorite collection of classical music and wedding music.

1,The one that raised the bar,"The is hands down the best car film. The innovative camera angles, mounted far shots right on the front bumper, to the deep and engaging storyline. Like most people, I bought this live action flick because I'm a huge fan of Initial D Manga and Anime. I was intrigued as to how they would be able to film and tell this story, mostly because it has a massive original story, to encompass that into 2 hours is most difficult. I believe the way it turned is excellent considering they had to change the storyline slightly from the original to have appeal as a standalone film. From beginning to end, this HK car flick is full of beauty, class, and professionalism, something not seen a whole lot in HK car flicks. Everything has a sense of artistic view, be it from mountain and Lake Akina shots, to the intense downhill battles, to the character dialogue. The camera work is absolutly stunning, and raises the bar not only for HK films, but the way they should be done here aswell.","The is hands down the best car film.

1,"An enjoyable, entertaining romp!","A book like this doesn't ask to be taken TOO seriously, so I didn't -- and I truly enjoyed it. The author is obviously interested in the ""mythology"" of the French -- as well as their passion for beauty, art, good food, and the pleasures of living well.There are some interesing bits of history laced throughout the text, including stories of infamous femme fatales, which made it fun to read. (I am not sure how well-researched these were, or where they came from, as there is little documentation here.)The way I read it, the book is more or less a long, entertaining essay on the allure of French women -- not an historic treatise and certainly not an insult to American women. The author herself is clearly writing as an American, with American perspective.With so few books available on this topic, I found this one a pleasant diversion.","A book like this doesn't ask to be taken TOO seriously, so I didn't -- and I truly enjoyed it.

1,And Then There Were Four,"More mature than their previous albums, the Spice Girls are back with their newest release, Forever. Although the music is beautiful and the words are more profound, the vocals seem to be lacking something--oh, I know, Geri. They just aren't the same without Geri's vocals gracing some part of their music. The Spice Girls just aren't right without Geri. This is still a great album, but only if you're not totally accustomed to Geri's vocals and music style. They seem to go on a rollercoaster of being mature to being teenage girls throughout this album, with songs like ""Let Love Lead The Way"", dealing with a girl and beauty problems, and then transitioning to a song like ""Weekend Love"", which deals with a guy doing a girl wrong, and the girl then doing the guy wrong. Spice Girls as the 5 were much better.","More mature than their previous albums, the Spice Girls are back with their newest release, Forever.

1,Just lovely!,"I purchased this set a week ago and I have to say, I open my cabinets just to look at them! This is the first set I have purchased of this quality and beauty. With 3 children, I have always stuck to plastic/cheap dishes for fear of them breaking. I finally splurged and decided that it was time to invest in something else. This is such a beautiful set! My dishes arrived in a large (heavy) box without one cracked/broken/chipped piece. We use them daily and I have received many compliments on them. I love filling my plate with food and admiring how gorgeous the set makes my food look!!","I purchased this set a week ago and I have to say, I open my cabinets just to look at them!

1,Best fushion since the 70's,"Front Page in my opinion is really,really good. Putting these three guys together was a good idea. Listening to Dominque De Pizzia is a real pleasure. The Jaco Pastorious influence is more then felt but it is totally in a good way, who doen't like Jaco? He also uses some really cool guitar techniques like a classical guitarist. Bireli the guitarist is awesome! Dennis Chambers needs no hype he's the man. I think this album combines elements of weather report and later John McLaughlin with alot of super fast unison guitar and bass passages. My favorite song on the record is The Eyes of Chirst. The sound the bassist gets on this cut is sheer beauty it also has a nice melody. You will find plenty of chops busting here. Take my advice buy this record!","Front Page in my opinion is really,really good. Putting these three guys together was a good idea. Listening to Dominque De Pizzia is a real pleasure.

And I agree with one of the other reviewers: you can barely see the action. The werewolf makeup/costumes aren't terribly great. And I can't figure out if I like the end of the movie or not (BTW, it's so broadcasted early on in the movie.) Mostly, when my cousins and I talk about this movie, it's titled as ""the movie we never speak of"".Mind, I have high standards for werewolf movies. This DEFINITELY did not meet my standards. I was really looking forward to renting it from my Movie Gallery, and I'd been putting it off and putting it off. Too bad I didn't decide to NEVER rent it.","The only good thing that came out of this movie was the plot, and a joke my cousin made while watching it. Werewolf with a flame-thrower.

1,The new Depeche Mode for 2000,"ok.....I am now in my 30's.....I grew up on Depeche Mode, Camouflage, and MANY other synth bands. Iris is leagues ahead of the rest. This is an exciting time for the re-birth of synth-pop.....many bands coming out on the ""A Different Drum"" and ""Metropolis"" labels. Iris and Apoptygma Berzerk are BY FAR the best. True synth-pop beauty with excellent song writing. This CD in particular is phenominal (their first cd ""Disconnect"" is amazing too). But Iris has really grown on this CD. The vocals, particularly, have matured to perfection. Just buy this if you want to hear the new kings of synth music. Iris is to me, the Depeche Mode of this decade.

This is an exciting time for the re-birth of synth-pop.....many bands coming out on the A Different Drum and Metropolis labels. Iris and Apoptygma Berzerk are BY FAR the best. True synth-pop beauty with excellent song writing. This CD in particular is phenominal their first cd Disconnect is amazing too. But Iris has really grown on this CD. The vocals, particularly, have matured to perfection. Just buy this if you want to hear the new kings of synth music. Iris is to me, the Depeche Mode of this decade.

0,Beauty and the Beast,"I was first stricken with the beauty of the design of this set, Logitech hit the bullseye with the look. Once I got the set home and got it installed, all without a hitch I might add, I found myself most pleased with the feel of the keyboard, it is a very comfortable keyboard and it is very quiet.But after about 2 months the beast began to emerge to my dismay and shock! I have been a loyal logitech user for sometime, never encountering any serious problems with any of their products, but after 2 months the left ctrl key just stopped working, nothing I could do to fix it. I also encountered frequent connection troubles with the bluetooth mostly with the mouse, I would often have to wait a few minutes after boot for the mouse to be connected.The sudden malfunctioning keys issue seems to be common among many users of this particular Logitech product, as well as the connection issues, in light of this I strongly urge buyers to look elsewhere for a keyboard and mouse set.","I was first stricken with the beauty of the design of this set, Logitech hit the bullseye with the look.

I always read her books at least twice because once I know the story I can read it slower and enjoy the beauty of her writing and the not so obvious jokes that I sometimes miss on the first pass.","Marian is such a talented writer, I love her books.

She seems not to really care of anyone but herself, and even his husband seemed a sort of price for her. I did learn not to be like her. Very, very cold and stupid individual, hence a very mundane book.She does not in any part of the book give even a little insight into the real beauty and important of dance.

1,My favorite mascara,"I used Lancome mascara for a long time till I tried makeup products at a Chanel counter, I am hooked on the mascara now. I use this mascara every single day and it has lasted me a long time. It goes on smoothly and elongates my lashes. It does not have an impact similar to what TV ads about mascara show, where the lashes are lengthened to crazy levels, this one adds slight volume and does not cause lumpy lashes. My previous Lancome one caused some lumps and my lashes stuck together sometimes, not this one. My eyes don't take makeup well, I always feel like there is some heaviness due to eyeliner and mascara, this one does the same but it has more to do with my eyes. I love Chanel makeup and will continue using this one for a long time to come.","I used Lancome mascara for a long time till I tried makeup products at a Chanel counter, I am hooked on the mascara now.

I saw them, talked with some of the musicians on different occasions. Wonderful people, great memories or the James Pub where they often were playing.Great album, of course. For me, in particular, a very nostalgic, incredibly emotional tune, ""Stella Maris"", composed by Doug Berch, who left the band a long time ago, so they don't play it anymore on stage. Stunning beauty, magical inspiration.

0,Not my style,"This book had been on my wish list for some time. I usually look for 5 star ratings, and this one had it. And I did read the reviews. So, it was a disappointment to receive it only to find out I didn't like the examples and had little use for the techniques. I love to create beautiful things--these collage examples aren't my idea of beauty. Not even all that interesting. And I just can't figure out what you would want to do with these things once done! Ick.Only one technique demonstrated that was interesting: crackle glazing with regular glue. I havw always only used a crackle glaze solution. This shows it can be done with less expensive and common products. But did this technique save the book? No, but that's just my opinion.","This book had been on my wish list for some time.

I know is horrible but you don't have to go around reiterating it. There are enough poor, trashy shows on now. Can't we have something good for once.

0,Skip This,"This movie is almost unwatchable. It's like Saving Private Ryan crashed into Black Beauty and all the good parts were destroyed.The first act seems to be written for 4 year olds. The script is so sickly sweet it gave me a headache and Director Steven Spielberg seems to have pulled the characters fro the book ""Cliche English characters for dummies"". Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching. This shouldn't matter really, because even though I'm a fan of some of Spielbergs' work he very rarely knows how to end his movies.Even worse than War of the Worlds. Don't waste your money.","This movie is almost unwatchable.

1,A very precise and descriptive look at all cacti.,"This is the most detailed source of cactus infomation that I have come across in the past eight years. The descriptions are very precise, especially; size, cultural habits,and all the basic growing necessities, with a great number of column cactus included. That's terrific! Most cacti enthusiasts will be overwhelmed by the photos(over 1200), which can captivate anyone into the beauty of cacti. Details such as: number of spines,ribs, and projected size can be a novelty for the ameteur collector. Also, there is added information about growing requirements,such as; light, temperature, water, and different soils mixes to be used for certain cituations. Mr. Innes and Mr. Glass have put together the best book on cacti that I had found,nevertheless, the price is very affordable.","This is the most detailed source of cactus infomation that I have come across in the past eight years.

The acting is pure ham, such as in Mars Attacks. The accents are overly done. The FBI agents hunting the pair are comical. The concept is original. The cast is full of stars. The dialogue is so-so, perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. The Elvis impersonators were so bad, you wanted them to die. Thank you.

However, Mr Spring and his buddy verbally accuse the lawbreaker and then speed away with no further action taken. This is after the author tells a story of himself shooting and not finding geese. Another example: Mr Spring and his wife go hunting using an old gun that apparently they did not sight in prior to the hunt. Then proceed to miss the game because they did not know where the gun was shooting. One of the most basic things a quality hunter does is prepare and practice with his or her chosen hunting equipment no matter what game is to be hunted.","If you are after me  Joe hunting stories this book is for you.

1,Love this face wash...normal/dry skin type,"I have normal to dry skin, but mostly on the drier side. This face wash is excellent! It leaves my skin feeling deeply cleansed without over drying it. It removes mascara and liquid eyeliner with ease and your skin is left residue free. I do agree that the smell can be a bit overwhelming, but you get use to it after prolonged use. After using this product for the last 6-8 months, I wouldn't switch to anything else and I work for a beauty company that manufactures luxury skincare. It is a great product and I have recommended it to family and friends.","I have normal to dry skin, but mostly on the drier side. This face wash is excellent!

1,can't believe I cried,"I agree with some of the negatives -- ending drawn out, Shah Rukh's aging makeup wasn't effective -- and the idea that there is only one love in a lifetime is depressing, yet, I believed this story; it's that way for some people. The development of their love was so believable, that when it couldn't fullfill itself due to external reasons I was as crushed as Shah Rukh. Overlaid on the story is a plea for peace between Pakistan and India. I am not an expert on the politics of that region but I think the separation had something to do with the time that the British were in control. See it, lose yourself, fall in love (if just for the running time).","I agree with some of the negatives -- ending drawn out, Shah Rukh's aging makeup wasn't effective -- and the idea that there is only one love in a lifetime is depressing, yet, I believed this story it's that way for some people.

1,Good for everything!,"I love these! I don't have a baby but I can imagine that they are gentle and effeective. I use these for everything: Taking off my makeup at night, a quick refreshing clean up on a hot summer day, a face wipe if I am rushed in the morning (which is always), wiping my feet, wiping down the toilet seat and counter tops in the bathroom, and of course for ""personal"" use. These are gentle, effective, and environmentally friendly. I buy them on Amazon because of the great price and because I use them all of the time so buying them in bulk is a good idea! The best part... They don't have that awful baby butt smell!","I love these! I don't have a baby but I can imagine that they are gentle and effeective.

0,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVIEW THIS,"This movie is hilarious. But bad... hilarious.I found myself bust out laughing at some really weird stuff and I'm not sure if it was intended or not.This movie will be a perfect candidate for MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 2020. If you love sitting around with friends and making up anecdotes to go along with the movie and laughing at your own jokes, this is a movie to pick up.I bought it, and I bought it for one reason... CHYLER LEIGH.She won me over in NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, and I think she has a bright future ahead. She's a fearless actress who has beauty, innocence and a wild side all rolled into one. I really just wanted to own it for the nostalgia of it, and I'm pleased with owning it, but to be fair....THE MOVIE gets 1 star, CHYLER gets 5 stars and it equals to an overall 2 stars... okay, so I'm weird.","This movie is hilarious.

1,Lovely addition to the classic ballet series.,"Just received my Titania doll yesterday. This is my first silver label barbie and so I was surprised that the box has a lid, information card and certificate of authenticity. Pretty neat!The dress is stunning with purples and greens, the hair is meticulously done, the face makeup is pretty but someone when crazy with the glitter (she has it on the tip of her hones and her chin instead of just on her eyelids).I was sad to see they didn't give her pointed ears like they did in the fairy series - after all she is the queen of the fairies!Overall she is a fabulous addition to my fairy and ballet barbie collection :)","Just received my Titania doll yesterday.

1,Nice Book,"The book is full of beautiful photography featuring napkins in different colors and styles. It contains information about the history of napkins, sizes and types. It also presents ideas for the table setting focusing on the napkins to create certain themes (such as white on white, checks & stripes, and middle eastern). There are instructions for nine styles of folded napkins with step-by-step illustration, in addition to a section on decoration your napkins.I enjoyed reading the book and flipping through the colorful pictures. I also used some of the presented ideas. However, a part of it is not very useful because it depends entirely on the beauty of the napkins and the tableware. In other words, if you cannot get the same set, you will not benefit from the idea. I also expected to find more styles of folded napkins.","The book is full of beautiful photography featuring napkins in different colors and styles.

1,A love story,"The beauty of ""Chosen by a Horse"" is that it isn't just for horse people. Susan Richards's story is about loss and love, universal emotions that anyone can relate to - though, of course, it is especially poignant for horse lovers. The story is honestly written, without apology, and is wonderfully constructed. Lay Me Down, Richard's mare, will touch anyone's heart.","The beauty of Chosen by a Horse is that it isn't just for horse people.

1,Classy and solid.,"The finish is a textured black metal, with slightly gold-tinged accents. The stapler has lots of heft, as expected of a solid-metal beauty like this---no plastic or ugly shiny finish here! It's an all-around superb piece of hardware that fully justifies the price.","The finish is a textured black metal, with slightly gold-tinged accents.

1,Everything You Need To Know To Live Victoriously,"The author of this book was not only saved in Dr. Lake's church in Portland,Ore.,he also traveled with Dr. Lake and stayed in his home, where he was healed of deadly food poisoning while reading these very sermons. Gordon Lindsay also pastored Dr. Lake's church in Texas for a while. The beauty of this book is in the fact that Lindsay did not add to or take away, he just published. These sermons by Dr. Lake are probably some of the best I have ever read. One sermon (p.75) tells you exactly how to know AND do God's Will, and how to be led by the Holy Spirit. As The General Overseer of Dr. Lake's organization, I have made this book mandatory reading for all our Bible College students, Ministerial Candidates, and Healing Room Personnel and patients. This one is a MUST READ.","The author of this book was not only saved in Dr. Lake's church in Portland,Ore.,he also traveled with Dr. Lake and stayed in his home, where he was healed of deadly food poisoning while reading these very sermons.

1,Love; Sorrow; one women's life story as the last of the favorites in a Sultans harem.,I could not stop watching it once I started.

The strength and courage of the main character._ Her will to survive and tenderness even after such loss in the world of men or Maybe because I'm older; but I felt such an affinity for the older version of the main character.

1,Didion writers are people too,"I have just finished reading ""The Year of Magical Thinking"" and was left with a few impressions. First, I did note the self-importance stain that marks the pages of this book. Didion is an artist, and this is important to remember. She places one of the greatest ordeals in her life alongside a poetic pseudo-stream of consciousness style, that vacillates between overwrought and transcendent. I have never had anyone close to me die, so I cannot speak to if this account will make grief more bearable. The conclusion Didion comes to is that time will serve as anodyne. I believe that a major purpose of literature, in book form, over something like a short story, is its ability to have a stronger affect on the reader. I must admit the verisimilitude had me ultimately able to smell Didion's hair and feel her breath. The beauty of any book dealing with death and loss is that in those final pages, form follows function.","I have just finished reading The Year of Magical Thinking and was left with a few impressions.

1,Just awesome,"I've had opportunity to sit under Keith's ministry when he came to visit our church in Swaziland last year September and this year in April. I must say that the man is trully anointed and has passion for what he does. The stlye of music is so diverse yet so uplifting. My all time favorites are Your Name, In the beauty of Holyness and the classical Jesus Be Glorified. If you ask me, this cd is a must have in your collection.","I've had opportunity to sit under Keith's ministry when he came to visit our church in Swaziland last year September and this year in April.

1,A Different View for Golf,"There are some of us who just want to play the game of golf without competing, without the the worry of handicaps, who just want to absorb the beauty of the course and the thrill of the game.If this is you, this book should be read and added to your library.This book won't instruct you how to improve your grip, or how to chip better but will open your mind to new ideas.","There are some of us who just want to play the game of golf without competing, without the the worry of handicaps, who just want to absorb the beauty of the course and the thrill of the game.If this is you, this book should be read and added to your library.This book won't instruct you how to improve your grip, or how to chip better but will open your mind to new ideas."
0,REFUND??,"BEAUTY--IF IT ONLY STAYED TOGETHERI fell in love with the shape and style of this piece, when i saw it at a friends house. However, her problems soon, became mine- No matter what we did the piece didn't stay together. Constant GAPS between the shelves and side panels and the shelves fell often. I've even used wood glue and am now trying new dowels, but to no avail. I own the rest of the collection, and this is the only one i've had problems with. I am inches away from putting it in the dump. What a pain and tragedy for such a beautiful piece.","BEAUTY--IF IT ONLY STAYED TOGETHERI fell in love with the shape and style of this piece, when i saw it at a friends house.

0,Guess I'm back to Cherry Chapstick,"If I was Miley Cyrus or even Hannah Montana for that matter, this would be my lip gloss. It's too teenybopish/ out in the clubs color and shine that you need sunglasses to look in the mirror. As a mature woman who is an RN this is not the look I'm trying to achieve. The Bare E. lip products I have been repeatedly disappointed with as the regular BD lipsticks had tons of staying power, but are far too drying. This said, I'm a cheerleader for the rest of their makeup line. Guess I will return to my Cherry Chapstick for now.

1,"Maxis, Please Hurry Up!","Although I, as many others have not played the Sims 2, rate it 5 stars because of my expectation. I have been to many websites, and can say that there will not be basements. In the Sims 2, they will not be able to do their laundry. Also, you will be able to put makeup on your Sims. I am almost 100% sure of all the preceding. I sincerely hope that Maxis makes this Sims the best it can be, without postponing the game release any longer.","Although I, as many others have not played the Sims 2, rate it 5 stars because of my expectation.

1,A True MASTERPIECE,"The appeal of this extraordinary film is almost entirely psychological. To appreciate it, you need to be the kind of person who enjoys watching others, attempting to figure out what's going on inside them by scrutinizing their behavior, their body language, their facial expressions. You have to enjoy forming and testing your own hypotheses about the motivations of the people you're watching. If you're that kind of person, this quiet, subtle film is gripping and intense.Profoundly moving and ultimately life-affirming, The Son is a highly intelligent film, an unforgettable experience, a true MASTERPIECE of cinema.It's impossible to say anything more specific about the plot or the characters without spoiling the film completely. Its beauty and power come from the way the story unfolds.","The appeal of this extraordinary film is almost entirely psychological.

1,Wonderful romantic movie with heartbreaking ending,"Huppert does a wonderful portrayal of an inarticulate beauty who falls in love with a law student. Inevitably their affair ends unhappily.

0,Doesn't work well with my foundation,"I tried the Beautyblender with Lancome Color Ideal makeup and it did not work well at all. It just seemed to absorb most of the foundation instead of spreading it nicely on my face. When it was time to clean the sponge with the cleanser, I had to use a lot of cleanser and scrub and scrub, and the sponge would still not come totally clean. This could be because my foundation has SPF in it or is oil free, but I still think the sponge is overrated. I feel like a fool for paying so much for a goofy pink egg and strongly scented cleanser. I never use it and hope to sell it if I can get it clean enough. A foundation brush works so much better.","I tried the Beautyblender with Lancome Color Ideal makeup and it did not work well at all.

0,Not what I hoped for,"I found this video to be not really that helpful. It's hosted by this lady whos just walks around her garden and shows us different stuff but doesn't get into any great detail on how to actually do things. This is set in Texas and so she talks about only things that would grow there, I wish I had known that before I bought the video. I was hoping for more detail on the types of plants and how she sets up the gardens. Some detail is shown on how she collects water, but not much. She shows how she raises the rabbits and how her set up is not really ideal. I feel sorry for those rabbits, she shows how she kills them and skins them, it was absolutely disgusting, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it, like a traffic accident! I know now that I sure would not be raising any rabbits! Overall low production value, didn't cost her a thing to make this video, she could have at least put on a bra and some makeup for it.","I found this video to be not really that helpful.

1,Planet Earth DVD,"An excellent way to travel our wonderful planet. This DVD is filled with knowledge and wonders that the average person would never experience. i.e. the depths of the sea where no light is ever present, the creatures of the sea floor that live and survive in dark cold waters. Caverns of beauty with natural crystal lighting. These two examples merely scratch the surface of what awaits. I was amazed at the many wonders that I never knew exist on our beautiful Planet Earth, you will be too. This DVD is worth every penny.","An excellent way to travel our wonderful planet.

1,Earth at its best.,"This DVD has been worth every penny. I had missed the original broadcast so I didn't know what to expect but guided by the reviews here, I was convinced. I popped in the first DVD, and was hooked. Never before had I seen such beautiful imagery, the images touched me. The shots and the speed effects are amazing whether they slow time down or speed it up. The narration is amazing as the narrator sounds like he knows about the subject and is passionate about it. The music used is non-intrusive and perfect for the occassion each time and every time.Buy it now and experience the dances of exotic birds, the tactics of hunting dogs, and the pure, virgin beauty of Planet Earth.","This DVD has been worth every penny.

1,Great Writing... Great Singing,"Joel Hanson is the former lead singer of the group PFR. I guess they never officially broke up as a group, maybe their just on hiatus.Anyway, I loved PFR and continue to enjoy Joel's work as a solo artist. The opening track, ""Still Greater"" is a super song. It is an upbeat, worshipful song. ""Bright as the sunshine... Beauty of Springtime... Deep as the ocean is... Your love's still greater."" (paraphrased that badly)The title track is also well done, ""Broken"". This sone is all about the way we need to be healed from the broken state we find our lives in without Jesus. Part of the chorus speaks about how pride is such a stumbling block to all humans. And only Christ can heal us from it. This is a very encouraging song.I have loved this CD and continue to listen to it often!","Joel Hanson is the former lead singer of the group PFR.

1,Maestro of the ferns,"Writing reviews on art is difficult and, most likely unfair. After years of collecting art glass, I have learned just a little. My home is a virtual ""Glass Menagerie"". My collection overflows with vases and animals. I needed a human form desperately. Thus, the purchase of this lovely, abstract human form with wonderfully executed color in the lower body. Imagination gives it a round ,crystal head and long, thin arms that reach up and cross over. I had plans for this piece.But, art has a mind of it's own. Especially when it comes to placement.It seemed awkward in it's designated location, and that detracted from it's beauty. It had to be walked around the house in order to find a home.At last, it found it's place in the sunroom, among the flowers and the ferns. It conducts a symphony of sorts. At night, I can almost hear the music of the ferns.","Writing reviews on art is difficult and, most likely unfair. After years of collecting art glass, I have learned just a little.

Thus, the purchase of this lovely, abstract human form with wonderfully executed color in the lower body. Imagination gives it a round ,crystal head and long, thin arms that reach up and cross over. I had plans for this piece.But, art has a mind of it's own. Especially when it comes to placement.It seemed awkward in it's designated location, and that detracted from it's beauty. It had to be walked around the house in order to find a home.At last, it found it's place in the sunroom, among the flowers and the ferns. It conducts a symphony of sorts. At night, I can almost hear the music of the ferns."

1,Stick with it,"If you are stuck in the past or only want to give this album a quick listen before passing judgment, then it's not for you. But if you are open to new things and give this album some time I think you'll find a jewel.I was skeptical on my first listening but as I listened more I found much beauty and depth that wasn't at first apparent. The old Eno is here; the poet of the obscure, the thinking musician, but with a new palette. Perhaps at first a jarring one to those of us raised on the 70s Eno. But if you open yourself up to it, you can find the same rewards as in the 70s masterpieces.There are plenty of musicians who are happy to be pale imitations of their former glory. Luckily, Eno isn't one of them.","If you are stuck in the past or only want to give this album a quick listen before passing judgment, then it's not for you.

1,An Excellent Read,"Some other readers have bashed this book for not being realistic about the horse aspects of the story. Well I say, if you want horse facts, get an equestrian book! This is a romance novel!! And an excellent one at that. The main character, Raine is a loveable young woman who's been overshadowed by her father's wealth and her older sisters' beauty all her life. Until she finally finds something that she was good at and could call her own--horseback riding. Her riding career culminates at the Olympic games where she meets our hero, Cord. The two share an undeniable attraction so powerful that it leaves them both off balance. Throw in some past hurts and a few very present dangers and you've got a real page-turner.","Some other readers have bashed this book for not being realistic about the horse aspects of the story.

1,Not a joyous recording...,"But it has the beauty of something dark lurking in cold troubled waters. I have no expertise to judge the piano work, but I felt it to be extremely sensitive and expressive beyond its flawlessness. I highly recommend this CD.","But it has the beauty of something dark lurking in cold troubled waters.

1,Praise from on high by JSB as told to MRL.,"At last I hear a rendering of my work I could have lived with. When you're here in the white light world it is hard to find anything interesting; all these harps twanging away are out of tune for the most part and they seem to favor the works of inferior talents like Heinrich Shutz (umlaut missing here). On occasion I monitor the fine recordings from down below of my works and it is gratifying that once or twice I've run across a few that do my polyphonic heart good. This is one such recording. The beauty of sound, phrasing, all the voices popping through, makes me want to write a few more. But perhaps not (they don't pay for my music up here). Anyway, send me more! Perhaps the sonatas?","At last I hear a rendering of my work I could have lived with.

1,Review of Lightness of My Being,"A true work of art transcends the technical. It lodges itself directly into your being by the sheer force of emotion from which it was created. Lightness of My Being was spawned of young talent still holding fast to ideals of a genre which has probably seen its greatest talent pass. Therein lies the beauty of this album. Though not perfect, its flaws are easily overlooked by those who simply love music. From the lightness of Alone Toghether and Vodka & Lime to catchy tunes like Grapefruit Lick, I found much of the album pleasant and entertaining. The original compositions held their own amongst the standards, a trait I find rare nowadays. But most of all, I was moved by the emotional Strawberries and Angels. With its powerful climax, it's probably the best and most sentimental track on Lightness. That all said, this album found its way to a permanent place in my 5-disc carrousel.","A true work of art transcends the technical.

1,The moon captured in poetry,"Moon Song has been my favorite childhood book since, oh, I don't know, kindergarten. I was drawn to the beautiful illustrations (my favorite being the zodiac picture that says nothing, but is worth a thousand words). Also the beauty of the writing, and the mysterious line that repeats about every other page: ""Only the moon man knows"". The book is set in a child's dream. I truly reccomend this book for a young child's bedtime story or for someone seaching for their ""inner child"". It brings memories of the days when everyday could be spent basking in the moon man's net ""fashioned of moonbeams three"".","Moon Song has been my favorite childhood book since, oh, I don't know, kindergarten.

0,Missed the Point,"While I agree that this is a beautifully animated movie in the spirit of early Irish art, it's all beside the point - how could the movie creators not understand what the early Irish monks meant by ""turning darkness into light""? The movie implies that the monks' efforts were to ""preserve knowledge through the time of the vikings"" - but they were not working on books of mathematics or history - they were creating Bibles. ""Turning darkness into light"" does not mean creating pretty pictures - it means sharing the ""light"" of God's word in places where it has never been. The movie was created around the lovely poem Pangur Ban but completely missed the reason for its loveliness and used the final line in a way that fails to communicate the true beauty with which the author was entranced. For this reason, and to my great disappointment, the Secret of Kells is exactly what its creators believe the Book of Kells was - a mere pretty picture.","While I agree that this is a beautifully animated movie in the spirit of early Irish art, it's all beside the point - how could the movie creators not understand what the early Irish monks meant by turning darkness into light?

1,works just fine,"I just wanted to say that the first review is incorrect. A simple search online or a look around in a beauty supply store or simply asking your hair stylist will let you know that though these rollers are called magnetic, they are not! That is just the name of the product. I have a few sets of magnetic rollers and I love them! They set my african american hair for the week as well as really lowering the damage to my hair (low heat setting on the dryer). If you're the type of person that is trying to lower their hair's exposure to heat yet still want to have a hair style, then rollersetting is the best thing.Here's a great site where you can start your hair journey right: [...]","I just wanted to say that the first review is incorrect.

1,Awesome for hair!,"Almond oil has been doing great things for my hair. Using it as either a hot oil treatment or simply putting it in when my hair has just been washed has made my hair smoother, shinier, less frizzy, and healthier! I also have used avocado oil and have found that it is much too heavy and greasy. The almond oil is light and the perfect consistency.It has also been great for my eyes and eyelashes. I use it as a makeup remover and it does a great job. It congruently makes my eyelashes stronger and has helped my dark circles.Great all around product and a must buy!","Almond oil has been doing great things for my hair.

1,My New Beauty HG,"I have been moving to using natural beauty products for the past year or so, and I decided to try this oil because I found that the application of coconut oil after a shower was a bit too complicated, because coconut oil is solid at room temperature. I also found coconut oil to be a bit too heavy to put in my hair. I love the way that this oil feels on my skin; it just drinks it up. I have very very sensitive skin, so I apply oil after I shower to avoid dry/itchy skin. I also put a few drops in my hair, once a week, in order to seal the ends. It isn't too heavy for my fine curly hair, and it has no odor at all. My skin/hair really likes this oil, and I will certainly be purchasing again. What a great find :)","I have been moving to using natural beauty products for the past year or so, and I decided to try this oil because I found that the application of coconut oil after a shower was a bit too complicated, because coconut oil is solid at room temperature.

0,Thank you,"Dear Amazon,Thank you for turning Anne Shirley into a sultry, bedroom eyed, blond girl. I realize now, having been raised in a home where I was taught that women are equal and not mere sex objects, that something was missing from my life. Thank you for showing me that my heroines are incomplete if they are not portrayed as sexy, that women are not strong or intelligent unless they can harness the power of seduction, and for providing me with the ideal image of feminine beauty so that I now have something to strive toward instead of embracing my own boring self.For your next cover, can you please ensure that Abra in East of Eden has cleavage up to her neck - since we all know that this makes her a more valid character, and that Ruthie Joad is clearly wearing a cheap polyester halter top and platforms. Failure to do so may encourage me to accept myself for the smart, strong, and independent woman that I am, and really... who would want that?Yours sarcastically,Lindsay","Dear Amazon,Thank you for turning Anne Shirley into a sultry, bedroom eyed, blond girl.

0,Cheesy Action Flick,"The beauty of action/adventure films is that they magically make the impossible seem plausible, and the ridiculous seem believable. However, Knight and Day fails miserably. At times, the action sequences appear to be better suited for a film spoofing the action/adventure genre. The hero-damsel story component is trite and drags the movie down. The movie comes off as a Danielle Steele attempt to write an action film for bored housewives.","The beauty of actionadventure films is that they magically make the impossible seem plausible, and the ridiculous seem believable.

1,Great book,"The Secret Life of Bees is a heartwarming story about Lily's need to feel validated and loved while enduring physical and emotional abuse as a child. The racial bigotry of that time adds to the raw hurt which each character lives with in their own separate circumstances. Additionally, each character grows and learns about the power of believing in a better life through their spiritual beliefs. The bees themselves represent the simplistic order and beauty that life can offer and also the power that they have. I strongly recommend this book.","The Secret Life of Bees is a heartwarming story about Lily's need to feel validated and loved while enduring physical and emotional abuse as a child.

1,One of my favorite lotions!,"I first tried this Neutrogena lotion as a sample from a hotel I was staying at and I was hooked from day 1. It goes on with a very light silky feel and though it has sesame seed oil in it, it does not seems greasy at all. Leaves your skin feeling soft but not ultra lotiony like shea butter type lotions.The scent is nice too - just a nice, clean, light, gender-neutral scent. I can't stand over-powering smells on beauty products.My only complaint is that I can't find this lotion in local retail locations. But as long as I can order that's fine.Would definitely recommend to a friend!","I first tried this Neutrogena lotion as a sample from a hotel I was staying at and I was hooked from day 1.

1,Powerful enough to reduce you to tears...,"After seeing the movie, I was enchanted by the images and sounds of the film for days. When I dicovered there was a score, I was frantic to buy it. Without a doubt, this is the most powerful CD in my collection. The tunes, though short, can greatly influence your mood. Listening to Track 1, ""Still Dead,"" can get you in an uplifting spirit; Track 2, ""Arose,"" will cause you to dream of private fantasies. The most powerful songs, Track 8 and 18, titled ""American Beauty/Still Dead,"" can bring tears to your eyes. The melancholy piano of those songs will bring you down into the greyest depression you've ever experienced, which is good every one in a while. If you loved the movie, or just liked it, get the CD.

1,Better than the soundtrack.,"I originally purchased the ""American Beauty"" soundtrack, which is a fine collection of songs ranging from Bobby Darin to Bill Withers. But it doesn't completely capture the heart of the movie like the score does. Thomas Newman's masterpiece scores, ""Dead Already"" and ""Still Dead"" are here, providing excellent bookends to a fabulous CD. My favorite selection is ""Root Beer,"" which is the song that played when Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham first set eyes on Mena Suvari's character while she was cheerleading in the gym. It alone makes this CD a must-have.","I originally purchased the American Beauty soundtrack, which is a fine collection of songs ranging from Bobby Darin to Bill Withers.

1,A Must Buy!!!!!!!!!!,"I fisrt purchased this CD about two years ago in Conner Pass in the Dingle Peninsula of Ireland. The music is absolutely beautiful. It has such an innocent quality that you can not help but fall in love with it. Completely instrumental, it soothes your heart just by hearing the first notes. If you buy the CD, share it and sends its beauty everywhere. I beleive that the best songs would be #1, Scarborough Fair because of its ability to tell a story through music and #5, Sheep Under the Snow for its harmony and wonderful music. Both are beautifully done and have such smooth rhthym. Some songs are traditional and others original but all will claim your loyalty. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.","I fisrt purchased this CD about two years ago in Conner Pass in the Dingle Peninsula of Ireland. The music is absolutely beautiful.

0,TERRIBBLE ending!!!,"I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!","I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end.

1,"Fantastic singer, marvellous human being","Phyllis Curtin's warmth, wit and beauty are strikingly evident in every note she sings. She's an underrated treasure in the United States -- an American soprano with equal parts of soul and panache. No other recording she's released has shown her to such great advantage, not even her historic recording of Floyd's 'Susannah' ... she's totally at home in the French art song repertoire, it's beautifully suited to her voice, the language is impeccable, and joie de vivre bubbles irrepressibly from every track. She completely inhabits Faure's elusive earth-goddess Eve, and the Verlaine settings are as crystalline a set of miniatures as anyone could wish. Ryan Edwards is wonderful as well. I heartily recommend not only this CD, but anything else with Curtin's name on the jacket.","Phyllis Curtin's warmth, wit and beauty are strikingly evident in every note she sings.

1,Good Read,This is my second book by Vicki Andrews and I must say that she has out done herself. The content of the book touches some very serious topics. The topic of low self esteem and racism was well written. It makes you sit and think about the things we have to face in life. You have to dig for your inner beauty. Alex was the type of guy everyone dreams to have. Although Danithia was a lawyer and he a security guard she did not hold back how she felt for him. The chemisty was very strong.Pick up this book it is very informative and you will truly enjoy it.,This is my second book by Vicki Andrews and I must say that she has out done herself.

1,If you love female bands give this a chance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I know that some old time Vixen fans might be put off that the only original member in this band is the guitarist, but I look at the beauty of Jan reforming her livelyhood, and giving her fans what they crave!!!!!!! For a band that is not equipped with its original members these girls have undeniable chemistry! I saw them live and they put on an incredible show. The CD is very catchy and the musicianship is tight. The singer has a bit of a Natalie Merchant quality mixed with her own uniqueness. Jan is quite the guitarist, she leaves me speechless. This is a straight up rock album. I love the Cd because it is not overly modern. It doesn't sound dated but they don't throw away their roots.","I know that some old time Vixen fans might be put off that the only original member in this band is the guitarist, but I look at the beauty of Jan reforming her livelyhood, and giving her fans what they crave!!!!!!!

1,"Likeable, Readable and Profound",Okay - so I've never thought about the actual mechanics of building a house nor about the choices that allow us to enjoy the beauty of the planet without doing it harm. My concerns have usually been of the strict ly visual - I am an artist . This book is almost startlingly good - Clarke Snell has managed to stimulate even the most laissez-faire amongst us to pay attention to laws respect ing our environment and combine them with our desires for beauty and comfort not only for the past but indeed for the future.,Okay - so I've never thought about the actual mechanics of building a house nor about the choices that allow us to enjoy the beauty of the planet without doing it harm.

1,Classic,"We are lucky that we N64 owners will one day look back on the late 90's and early 00's with nostalgic feelings when we consider the great games we had. Mario 64, Zelda 64, Majora's Mask, DK64, Shadowman (most underrated game ever) Superman 64 (excuse me, Freudian Slip) Goldeneye, and this most of all, this beauty of a game. I got hours of enjoyment from this game, and I am sure most of you did as well.","We are lucky that we N64 owners will one day look back on the late 90's and early 00's with nostalgic feelings when we consider the great games we had.

1,A Unique Expose of Einstein's Relativity,"There are hundreds of books that claim to simplify the theory of relativity for the general public. ""Inside Relativity"" is among the few that actually achieve this goal without loosing the beauty of Einstein's theories. The strength of the book comes from the structure as well as its cogent language. Many others fail to set the context for Einstein's entrance into the scientific scene but Mook & Vargish do this quite masterfully. There are many valuable references sprinkled throughout the book. I did consult few of them before finishing the book and that may have biased my opinion. This book should be on your bookshlef even if you think you know what Relativity is all about.",There are hundreds of books that claim to simplify the theory of relativity for the general public.

0,fancy phone but not good,"I've own this phone for 2 months and felt quite disappointed. The phone looks beauty and cool. However, since it is too thin and wide, the feeling in hand is not so good. As everybody knows, the battery sucks. With wired ear bud, it may support talk time from 2 hours to 3 hours at most. But with bluetooth ear bud, most of the time, it can only have 1.5-hour talk time. But when you use BT ear bud, the phone automatically disable all the customized the ring tones, so that you have no way to know who's calling you from the ring tones. The only good thing of this model over my old V300 cell phone is the mini USB port which let me easily download/upload pictures and ring tones from my computer. But the software is not come with the phone. Same as V300, you still have to buy the software. Luckily, you save the money for the data cable, if you have a digital camera or camcorder which uses the same mini USB cable.","I've own this phone for 2 months and felt quite disappointed.

1,"No more swollen, bloodshot eyes, itching, flaking, redness.","I have horrible eczema. This has worked wonders and I have tried them all. Several lotions mentioned in these reviews are pretty good, but this by far is the best. It has a thick texture which takes a little getting used to, but absorbs quickly and works well even under makeup. I like it better than Vanicream's lite version because it seems to moisterize and protect better, at least as a face cream. The lite Vanicream might be better for your hands to avoid getting lotion smudges on what you touch.","I have horrible eczema. This has worked wonders and I have tried them all.

0,Great book... in paperback,"This book deserves five stars in my mind, in physical form. Kindle edition on the other hand earned this book the above one star, mis-types and spelling errors run rampant and detract much from the beauty of this story, at some points the paragraphs seem to end part way through, leaving you to wonder what you are missing. I can tollerate the occasional mis-type but come on, it's as if they ran a spell checker and just chose the first available word. Toc the Younger is now Toe the Younger and Morn is now Mom, those two are the most blatant and repetitive, the problem is when the subject is something the reader is less familiar with and has no way of referencing to make sure the translate and associate it right. Great book but do yourself the favor of buying the paperback else you will be lost.","This book deserves five stars in my mind, in physical form.

If you must see this then fast forward to where the Asian lady bares hers - not only are they much better but she can act better also!","I have never been an admirer of Keira Knightly - She is always aware of the camera focusing on herself and cannot act naturally.I have become amazed to find that others seem mesmerized by her so called beauty and somehow become hoodwinked into believing that she has some kind of talent.Well, this movie should dispel all myths!Ms Knightly here tries to portray an American, but can't even hold up the accent for long.If I were the husband that she has in this movie I would scarper to the far east and shack up with an Asian beauty and never return to the pale faced wanna be actress!The story, by the way, is possibly the worse that I have encountered within the last decade.I would recommend that you avoid this movie at all costs - even though Keira bares her tiny breasts!

1,An unexpected gem,"One of my very favorite books, read in a single night at Christmas. It's that sort of book - small enough to read all at once, but broken into little vignettes one could treasure night after night. Each vignette, loosely bound together with a wraparound plot featuring Albert Einstein, depicts a different reality from our own, where time functions differently. In one, time runs backward; in another, time is a literal location you can walk toward or away from. Another reality holds people without long-term memory, and everyone's past is written down in books. How similar or alien these worlds are to our own lie mostly in the mind of the reader...and that's half the beauty of it. The prose is simple and tight, but the ideas are absolutely breathtaking. If you want a nice quiet read on a summer's day, or a near-Christmas night, I couldn't recommend this enough.","One of my very favorite books, read in a single night at Christmas.

1,A beautiful tribute to two geniuses,"With the recent passing of Peter Ustinov, this tape has taken on added meaning. In this one hour visit, Peter Ustinov interviews Luciano Pavarotti at Pavarotti's summer home in Italy. It is an absolutely capitivating, enchanting experience, as the two men share their thoughts and philosophies on acting, food, art, tennis, music, and life in general. At the risk of using a cliche, the two have a marvelous ""chemistry,"" and it is apparent that each has great respect and admiration for the other. The viewer is treated to glimpses of Pavarotti's performances, and of Peter Ustinov's wit and varied dialects. The kitchen scene involving Ustinov observing Pavarotti preparing dinner is worth the price of the video! The discussion of philosophy and the feeling of the two men as to the beauty of ""silence"" is an insight into the souls of these two great performers, and I cannot recommend this video enough. I would truly love to see the program released on DVD.","With the recent passing of Peter Ustinov, this tape has taken on added meaning.

1,One of The Best styling products for Fine - Med curly hair,I bought Curlfriends gel first in the summer of 2006. It is definitely a Friend to Curls! i use this product on fairly damp hair and get amazing smooth frizz-free curls.My favorite way to style with it is to make a 'cocktail' of a dollop of CFs Gel and just a pea size dab of Pureology Powerdressing for extra shine and body. I have intense sensitivity to many perfumes however the Curlfriends fragance is very light and has a pleasant aroma.

1,Tasco Target/Varmint 6-24x42mm Mil Dot,This is an awesome scope for the money. I mounted her on my Remington 700 SPS SS and it's a beauty. I would recommend this scope for anyone that is trying to get the best bang for their buck. I mounted with Leupold dual dovetail rings and the two piece dovetail mounts. I've put about 100 rounds through the gun and the scope hasn't moved a millimeter. The scope was accurate out of the box and a simple bore sight and a couple of rounds and she's pinpoint at 200 yards. There is a little blur after 18x but thats to be expected with a smaller objective and only a 1in tube. I really like this scope and am glad I got it. The adjustments are easy to make with the big knobs. Good scope all around.,This is an awesome scope for the money. I mounted her on my Remington 700 SPS SS and it's a beauty.

1,Great film with two famous stars,"Both Davis and Crawford give great performances in this strangely offbeat film of two aging sisters living a weird and bizarre life together in a no longer so glamorous neighborhood.Davis is particularly horrible looking, with heavy white pancake makeup, and painted on lips and creepy eyebrows. Her cackling laugh and voice are very disarming as well.Crawford plays the invalid with much pathos. Both women portray what can happen to any of us in life. The sad decline of these women into a very weird life style is a great psychological horror story, that is both fascinating and disturbing.Victor Buono also gives a bizarre performance that fits perfectly into the behavior of the two female leads.","Both Davis and Crawford give great performances in this strangely offbeat film of two aging sisters living a weird and bizarre life together in a no longer so glamorous neighborhood.Davis is particularly horrible looking, with heavy white pancake makeup, and painted on lips and creepy eyebrows.

1,Must Have!!!!,"I ""mistakenly"" found the Saw Doctors when I downloaded one of their songs by mistake off the interent. They quickyl became my favorite band and now I have all of their CD's. This was the first one I bought and I highly recommend it to anyone that is just discovering the Saw Docs. Their isn't a bad song on the album. It shows the range of the Docs music from partying Irish pub (""Hay Wrap, I Useta Lover) to singing of the beauty of Ireland (""Green and Red of Mayo, Clare Island) to their great songs about love and relationships (""Share the Darkness, Wake Up Sleeping, Red Cortina). This is a great CD to start with. One you buy this one, you'll certainly get the rest.One thing, to truly expreience the Docs, you have to see them live in concert. I brought my brother and friend to a show. They never heard a song by the Docs, but after the concert, they were hooked. See them live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I mistakenly found the Saw Doctors when I downloaded one of their songs by mistake off the interent.

1,This record turned me on to jazz!,"Back in college circa 1986, I found this album in a second hand bookshop. I knew nothing about jazz at the time... but the cover design was so wonderful (I was a graphic design buff at the time) I just had to have it. Then I played it. Wow. To this day that moment remains one of the top 3 most seminal experiences in my love affair with music. Since then I've bought over 20 Miles records, most of which are outstanding but somehow none of them have the classic, simple beauty and economy of this record. This record will always occupy a favored spot in your collection should you wish to purchase it. Everything that makes people fall in love with jazz in in this recording. I cannot recommend it highly enough.","Back in college circa 1986, I found this album in a second hand bookshop.

1,Beautifully designed overview of salmon and their plight,"This book is beautifully illustrated with photographs, illustrations, and the most detailed distribution maps I have ever seen. The design of the book makes it a perfect coffee top book and it's content makes it both a perfect introduction to the world of salmon while at the same time a valuable scientific reference.This book is very accessible to non-scientists, if you are looking for a book about how salmon, man, and the enviroment interact this is a great book.

1,Love the product but hate the itemi received,The brush itself is great. I don't think it helps too much with static but I love the metal bristles. My problem is with beauty time who I purchased from. The brush had bristles missing and the ones still there had glue all around the bottom. It's still useable but it's not what I paid for. I haven't bothered contacting the because I would spend more on return shipping then I probably spent on the brush. Go to a store and buy it if you want one.,The brush itself is great.

0,NOT FOR A CHILD!!,"This is a very nice adult airplane, but not recommended for children as the box says. After a few crashes there are numerous things that have to be glued back.

1,How can a Lewis Black fan NOT love this?,"I realize this is not typical Lewis Black material on many levels, but it is also very much a Lewis Black gem. It's different, hysterically funny, dark, sarcastic and intelligent - everything you would expect from Lewis Black.Several reviewers were upset this was unlike seeing or watching Lewis Black and his typical ranting, but in that is the beauty of this crazy creation. Yes, you see a lot of people you may or may not know and yes, it's not all about Lewis Black. However, it IS all about ALL of us.I laughed from beginning to end. I saw myself and literally anyone and everyone I have ever known in it. We as a whole are not a perfect society and this piece makes light of the insanity we have ALL witnessed.","I realize this is not typical Lewis Black material on many levels, but it is also very much a Lewis Black gem.

0,Completely Insulting,"Within the first few pages of the book, i began to understand the author's purpose, simply debase a culture not her own. I grew up in India and i simply could not understand where all the supposed descriptions were coming from. Real beauty or the ability to see it does not come from having a closed and prejudice mind. The beauty that the author looks for is the generic beauty, found all over the world, but India has the beauty not only by the wonderful environment but the spirit of the people as well. This book really does portray India as some kind of savage land and that is something i cannot put uo with.","Within the first few pages of the book, i began to understand the author's purpose, simply debase a culture not her own.

1,extremely satisfied,"I purchased this product solely by looking at it online. I never have bought any cosmetic online that I hadn't already seen in person or used. I received it very fast and put on immediately--I was very pleased with the results! It's even nicer on than it looks in the bottle! The only problem I have with it is, for some reason, the brush is thicker than other nailpolish brushes so it's hard to polish my pinky nails (I have very small hands) and therefore gets on my cuticles. But other than that, I love this color and OPI is a great product. I would buy other colors online, as they have great colors and are cheaper than getting in any store even with the shipping!","I purchased this product solely by looking at it online.

1,Adventure in Venice,"The Tourist starts out with Angelina Jolie ordering a croissant in a Parisian cafe with stylish flair, and as it turns out, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. Sophisticated in its beauty, lush with Venetian motif, and with such charming actors, to watch The Tourist is to become enchanted with the imagery and the romantic idea of Venice, more than with Venice itself. The Tourist is to Venice what Roman Holiday is to Rome.The movie's soundtrack is effective if not memorable, with a few nice surprises, including an appropriately subtle taste of Katie Melua in one scene which made me fall in love with her vocals all over again.Apart from the imagery is a casually-paced plot with enough humor and suspense to sustain interest throughout the movie, but is it enough to make this a classic? Will this stand the test of time? Probably not. Other than the sheer beauty, there is little here of lasting value. All the more reason to appreciate the fun while it lasts.","The Tourist starts out with Angelina Jolie ordering a croissant in a Parisian cafe with stylish flair, and as it turns out, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film.

1,Raw & steely acoustic blues,Furry was born in Mississippi in 1900 but moved to Memphis early on. These tracks were (very well) recorded in 1962 & 1967 by George Mitchell. They feature Furry on voice & acoustic slide guitar. Despite being alone he manages to make one hell of a sound. The most apparent feature of this sound is the unity of the voice & guitar - the guitar doesn't accompany the voice but rumble under & weave around it - creating gorgeous orchestral textures - a lot of open strings & undamped slide work. The voice is majestic - strong & heavy with experience - from a time before words like beauty & refined existed. You experience a simple slice of Furry's life - nothing special or contrived - but immensely rich & honest & uncompromising. It's the sort of music you feel you could listen to forever.,Furry was born in Mississippi in 1900 but moved to Memphis early on.

1,Beautiful Fairy Tale,"""Somewhere in Time"" offers a fairy tale of impossible love, two beautiful lovers, a fine supporting cast, and depicts a striving for hope beyond mortal reality. The setting--the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, MI--is perfect for this story, and the film makes excellent use of the Island's timeless(!) beauty. Definitely a ""chick flick,"" the film requires several hankies but leaves viewers smiling through their tears. I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, but I've spent, at least, five evenings with ""Somewhere..."" throughout the years, and expect to watch it again soon.","Somewhere in Time offers a fairy tale of impossible love, two beautiful lovers, a fine supporting cast, and depicts a striving for hope beyond mortal reality.

In some cases a total stripping down and reworking of a song can work wonders for it and create a new audience for the artist as well some more cash for the record company but not in this case. The beauty of the song was the opening guitar hook which is almost absent here. Some things are better left untouched and that hook is one of them.

(And by all means, avoid John Mauceri's version with its heartless cuts.)","Well, nearly forgotten, and undeservedly forgotten. Does it transport me to another world because I first heard it when young and impressionable? No, there's beauty and emotional power in the music that makes listening an adventure every time, and I feel sorry for anyone not swept away by it. This is the best recording of several I've heard, my only complaint being the distant banjo. Altogether, it's an excellent performance and recording.

0,"Do not buy, not durable","We used this stroller four times and it broke (the connection for the car seat). It was fixable, but my fear is I will be travelling and have the stroller break again at which point I will have a lot of unusable plastic to carry around while trying to get home. Some of the cosmetic features have also fallen off.We have had no luck with the business where we purchased it or the manufacturer. I have no faith in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.","We used this stroller four times and it broke the connection for the car seat.

0,Not a good book for beginners,"I am starting my professional career in makeup artistry, but this has been a hobby of mine for 20 years. This book does have great information. It has solid foundation/building blocks explaining the different tools & types of makeup. It does not have great instructional steps for a beginner. Get a Kevyn Aucoin book like, ""The Art of Makeup"". There are much better instructional steps in that book. I was planning on getting ""Makeup Makeovers: Weddings"" by the same author and decided to get this one because it's available via Kindle. Huge disappointment. I disagree with the shape assessments and it's too difficult to match a face to his description because it's not on the same page. I will not purchase that book after this huge let down. Once again there is good reference material in here and I'll be able to use a bit of what is offered in this book, however I knew most of the information in this book already.","I am starting my professional career in makeup artistry, but this has been a hobby of mine for 20 years.

1,Very Cool Yoga Workout,"I recently got hold of this one and I am so glad that I did. I had put off buying it because of reviews which spoke of Ana's near naked body. All I can say is that it must be all sour grapes. While you can see a hint of Anas nipples. I don't think I would have even noticed if they had not had so much press!Ana is beautiful and I think she can expect a lot of arrows slung her way. It is unfortunate. This DVD is a classic. The workout is first rate. The demonstration(by Ana)is first rate. The voiceover by Ravi is also first rate.I like Ana's almost goth/ almost japonese makeup. The way her hair flops about as she performs with perfect precision. The lighting. The blue and pink set.You also see Ravi make a rare appearance at the beginning and end of the workout.No matter what type of yoga you do, what level you are, or even if you have never done yoga. I highly recommend you buy this one.I am only sorry I did not get this one earlier. I now have a lot of catching up to do!","I recently got hold of this one and I am so glad that I did.

1,The Best Dido Of All,"In my not very humble opinion, no one has sung this role better than Dame Janet. For nobility of expression, intensity of feeling, tonal beauty and almost unendurable grief she is unmatched. If you are unaware of the artistry of Janet Baker, this is an excellent place to start your discovery of one of the greatest, and now - sadly - somewhat forgotten, interpretive artists of our time.

1,"Best for fine, wavy hair! 10 years and going...","I was recommended to try this product at least 10 years ago at Pure Beauty in SF. I rarely do a review on products but I really put this in my top 3 beauty products that I love. I have thick, yet fine textured and wavy hair. I can blow it out straight very easily, or wear it natural & wavy. This is the BEST product I have used when I want wavy hair (once used BedHead Curl Activator (sp?) and it was so crunchy and made my hair do ringlets). ISO Bouncy Creme gives my hair beachy, loose waves and people always ask me if I style or curl my hair and all I say is I use this cream on my wet hair and I'm done. I think a good, layered haircut is key also. Also, there is no crunchiness with this product, it feels like a body lotion and doesn't weigh hair down either. Perfect!","I was recommended to try this product at least 10 years ago at Pure Beauty in SF. I rarely do a review on products but I really put this in my top 3 beauty products that I love.

1,Southern Belle---: from Czars to Confederate soldiers and more.,"Lucy Holcomb(e) was born into a Southern Family of means. This book covers her life as a spoiled but spirited debutante to a woman who spent years with her husband as America's representatives to the Czar of Russia. But this fantasy life quickly changed as her husband returned to his native South to fight in the Civil War. This book does a good job of delving in to her work for the South that along with her beauty... led to her place on Confederate $100 bills. I found this a very interesting side view into life in the South before, during and after the Civil War. I recommend it to anyone interested in the Civil War... and also to anyone wanting to discover another strong woman in a time when women were not expected to be active in marriage and definetly not in war.","Lucy Holcombe was born into a Southern Family of means.

0,very poor performance for the money,Purchased a cover in 2007 when I bought a new truck. The FIRST cover had abrasions along the rubber gasket. as this was only cosmetic I let it go. Within the year all taped joint started to come off (still cosmetic). I returned it to the place of purchase and it was replaced. The new one did exactly the same thing within a few months. They refused to replace it again. I have lived with it until a year ago and I then noticed the black vinyl which covers each panel had cracked in numerous places. I have attempted to re glue this with little success. A $1000 cover is now garbage! BUYER BEWARE !!!,Purchased a cover in 2007 when I bought a new truck.

1,Truly enlightening!,"I'm a sucker for Rev. M.E. Dyson's books so this review will be slightly biased. Firstly, I love how Rev. Dyson's describes the women he admires in his book. Every woman is depicted beautifully, their physical, emotional and spiritual beauty. His words are riveting and he describes each woman's work with respect and awe. As a young African-American woman, it warms my heart to see a prominent African-American man speak of women in such an uplifting and admirable manner. Rev. Dyson gives an insightful male perspective of the AA woman's struggles and accomplishment. I'm almost done with it and I have to say, it has encouraged me to 'keep on keeping on' because there are many out there who depend on us making it.","I'm a sucker for Rev. M.E.

1,Another essential and timeless classic!,"I have to admit that I never really ""got"" all the hype about ""Where the Wild Things Are"". Sure the drawings were great, but the story never really drew me in. Now that I've seen and read ""In the Night Kitchen"" I am the biggest Sendak fan!

The drawings are amazing -- reminiscent of ""Little Nemo In Slumberland"".Sendak is one of those rare children's authors that seems to have never forgotten what it was like to be a child.

1,BETTER THAN ALL OTHER MOISTURIZERS!,"I just started using this cream two days ago and I am so impressed. My senior citizen (that's all I'm saying) skin looks hydrated, plumped up, and thicker. I've been wasting so much money on all types of expensive skin care over the years and none of them ever showed any difference; in fact, some of them really irritated my skin so I was getting desperate. I read about this Ponds cream on a beauty forum and decided to try it. Boy, what a wonderful surprise. Now I'm not saying it reduced wrinkles or sagging, but it sure did plump up my skin and it is glowing and my makeup goes on beautifully. Won't go back to any other skin care.","I just started using this cream two days ago and I am so impressed. My senior citizen that's all I'm saying skin looks hydrated, plumped up, and thicker.

1,Tebaldi is breathtaking as Tosca.,"To be sure, we have so few video memories of the Golden Age of Opera, in other words when opera singers were worth a damn. But this is a purists dream come true. Tebaldi at her very peak, truly showing why she was the very best spinto soprano ever. She has the tonal beauty required of this difficult tole, along with her ringing Cs and dramatic acting. A great opera to own, I only started a year ago, and this one I have loved the most. Puccini at his finest. Truly a must have.","To be sure, we have so few video memories of the Golden Age of Opera, in other words when opera singers were worth a damn. But this is a purists dream come true.

1,Closer to the heart of life's mysteries,"There is something delicious and maddening about D.E's stories. Delicious because her prose is so cool and lucid, her take on emotional subtext in the interaction between people so accute. Maddening because she brings you so close to people's souls. There is something infuriating about knowing people like that and then having them vanish. In a way it's an argument for novels, though satiation always makes youa little ill.I think D.E. is a brilliant realist. I've just surfed around the Amazon reader reviews for the first time. It's amazing, but worrisom, all those voices, because so many seem enthralled by fantasy. Eisenberg is about the real. That she is able to elucidate often painful situations with such beauty and wit is our good fortune.","There is something delicious and maddening about D.E's stories.

1,A great read,"When a non-fiction book reads like a fiction book, I know I'm in for a great treat. That is, I find myself looking for little breaks during the day when I natch a page or two to read this book, I know that I have a winner. This is also written by a women who has learned a little bit about life in her winter job as a avalanche expert in Alaska, and she brings this understanding to her passion of rowing in the polar regions. It is Jill's descriptions that are a delight to the mind because they are so well written. Although, I have never seen as ice berg or an ice field, I feel that I have some greater appreciation of the beauty and harm (yes,harm) that they are capable of doing in a split second. I remember the words of some great sage, that said that getting there is what travel is all about, versus vacation when you take a jet and lay in a lounger by the pool.","When a non-fiction book reads like a fiction book, I know I'm in for a great treat.

For being called Zombie Nation, there was barely a zombie in sight: 6 zombies total!!!! 6! The zombies consisted of women with heavy eye makeup. Bad makeup, bad acting, bad plot, bad movie.

0,Disappointed with this product,"Being in the market for a 7 qt. enameled cast iron dutch oven, the 7 qt.

As other reviewers have noted, the bottom was not flat and the pot would actually rock on the stove top. There were 3 pin-hole defects in the interior enamel resulting in exposure of bare metal. Cosmetically, the exterior enamel was uneven. Would these issues effect cooking ability? Maybe not, but this product apears to be a cheap chinese knock-off. So, I have returned this $165 (Amazon price) item and went out a bought a $250, 71/4 qt. Le Creuset at a local retailer - note that this price differential is $85, not $100+ or ""double "" the price as stated in some reviews.

0,BEWARE OF BEAUTY BRIDGE,"How would I rate this nail polish? Honestly, I can't tell you. After 3 weeks of waiting I still have not received my package.

I have not been refunded the cost of the item nor the shipping. Fussing about $18 + the shipping cost seems a bit dramatic, however I might as well have burned my money. I have nothing to show for it! Bottom line-- DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH BEAUTY BRIDGE! Find another vendor on amazon.com who sells the SAME item.","How would I rate this nail polish?

1,The pinnacle of all human accomplishments.,"As pure Art, as magnificent intelligence incarnated as absolute beauty, this is the greatest book ever written by human hands. It is a terrible thing to contemplate that 150,000 people die every day without having read this book.

Second, that no matter how deep a scientific idea is, it can still be explained to any intelligent reader, without using obscuring clouds of mumbo-jumbo.Artificial Intelligence, mathematics, cognitive science, computer programming; art, music, language; it doesn't matter whether you know them, or you want to know them, or you just want an unlimited amount of amazing fun - read this book. I could spend the rest of my life reading this book and I would still be noticing wonderful new gems.","As pure Art, as magnificent intelligence incarnated as absolute beauty, this is the greatest book ever written by human hands.

1,A Movie for the Dreamer,"Contrary to what everyone else thinks about ""Seamless"", I thought it was an artistically brilliant movie about the true meaning of family. Sure, the acting was bad and the effects weren't great, but the movie reaches a philosophy that any true raver would understand: raves aren't about the drugs, they're about peace, love, unity and respect. This movie demonstrates all of these ideals. The description is misleading though. Very little of ""Seamless"" actually takes place at raves. Overall, it has an undertone of ecclesiastic beauty. If you're looking for hardcore drug scenes and rolling ravers, rent ""Party Monster"" or ""Groove"". ""Seamless"" is meant for the open-minded dreamer who wishes all the world could be full of unconditional love.","Contrary to what everyone else thinks about Seamless, I thought it was an artistically brilliant movie about the true meaning of family.

1,Happy Holiday,"This book is stunning. It is over the top and took a few glances before I really could absorb its beauty. I so fell in love with it, that I designed my own Tiffany Table for Christmas. My mom is elderly and not quite use to this holiday decorating approach. Initially she didn't know what to make of it, but eventually fell in love with it and would call me to come turn on the lights so that she could view it from the next room where she usually sits. I can hardly wait to do it again next year. Great book!","This book is stunning. It is over the top and took a few glances before I really could absorb its beauty.

0,Small Poems are not why Rumi is famous??!!,"It is interesting that westerners are so Islamophobic that they totally omit Rumi's most important work about Islamic Mysticism (aka sufism) which is called the Mathnawi ( a six volume Poem).The Mathnawai is Rumi's best work and has been translated in english beautifully, while being itself a work of immense and sublime beauty.

0,Creamy Formula but Allergen Inducing - SOY,"This is a great creamy lotion cleanser for all skin. Unfortunately for me, after using this for a few weeks I noticed little red bumps everywhere on my face. When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear. I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno's soy-based line is a no-go for me...I can ONLY use their oat-based line of products). So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren't allergic to soy. Otherwise, stay away! I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!)

1,Intergration! Not Assimilation!,"The novel captures the belief systems of two equally represented, and conflicting cultures. As an anthropology and sociology student this novel provided a detailed description of how experiences are bounded within societal constraints. It details the journey of a unique culture- the Hmong, their life long journey to resist assimilation, and specifically a Hmong family¡s encounter with the American medical system. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in a better understanding of the self and others, because it not only teaches the beauty of cultural difference, but the need for acceptance over assimilation.","The novel captures the belief systems of two equally represented, and conflicting cultures.

""Nella Fantasia"" takes me on a wondrous journey through dreamland, and I cannot listen to ""Love of My Life"" without tears welling up in my eyes. ""Green Fields of France"" will surely leave the listener with a stark sense of how terrible war is, regardless of political views or national/cultural backgrounds.

1,Shakespeare-san,"The story of Macbeth is firmly rooted in western minds in Birnam Wood, and this is well-portrayed in Roman Polanski's version of the tale (q.v.). Akira Kurosawa, however, who was long a fan of Western culture over his native Japanese society, has translated it well for the feudal Japanese setting into which he injects it. It loses some of the beauty of Shakespeare's original language, as a previous review suggested, but the story drives along at a pleasing clip and the characters pop off the screen and stick with you. Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of the warlord Washizu is much more pleasing to this viewer than his role in ""Yojimbo,"" the movie that made him a star. One note of intrest only to people like myself: this movie is worthless for practising Japanese. The ""nihongo"" in this movie is out of date and doesn't jibe with what you get in your college courses.","The story of Macbeth is firmly rooted in western minds in Birnam Wood, and this is well-portrayed in Roman Polanski's version of the tale q.v..

0,not worth your while,"There are many great reference books out there to guide fans both old and new through the intricacies of Tolkien's Middle-Earth. This is not one of them. While this book does contain a good deal of accurate information, much of the rest is either David Day's own invention or just plain wrong. The composite map at the beginning of the book scarcely even makes sense when compared to those drawn by Tolkien himself. The book is an interesting conversation starter, but it is not faithful to The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. It gains a second star primarily because of the beauty of some of the illustrations it contains. For a true encyclopedia of Arda, search elsewhere.

1,Great Sleep AND Great Price,"We purchased this air bed so our guests no longer had to sleep on the highly uncomfortable ""hide-a-bed"" in the couch. After reading many reviews, we decided to go with the Simmons Beautyrest because 1) their regular beds are amazing and 2) the price of the queen air bed was basically unbeatable for the quality. Needless to say, we have not been disappointed. The in-laws recently visted for 7 days and slept on the air bed. We inflated the bed when they arrived and it remained fully inflated for all 7 days (and we did not need to even put additional air in!) The air pump is incredibly quick both for inflation and deflation...less than 3 minutes each way for our queen bed. When deflated, the bed stores easily in a provided storage bag. We highly recommend this air bed based on comfort, durability, ease of use, and outstanding price compared to other queen size air beds!","We purchased this air bed so our guests no longer had to sleep on the highly uncomfortable hide-a-bed in the couch.

1,Great bed for sore backs,"We have had 5 Simmons BeautyRest air beds in the past 7 years, using them as the mattress over a traditional box springs. It looks like a regular mattress when covered. We use one blanket over the mattress then a good mattress pad. Using such an extremely comfortable sleep surface makes sleeping on motel beds feel like pool tables. We buy a new mattress every year and a half due to pin-point leaks than are impossible to find and patch, but the expense is worth the superb sleep. I like the rounded sides of the pillow top much better for comfort than the frame around a Select Comfort.The bed stays aired well, with quarterly additional air additions. I recommend air levels based on how many are sleeping on the bed so don't air it ultra tight then get on it as the weight will possibly cause a leak. Air it slightly under tight then add both people and adjust up/down from there.","We have had 5 Simmons BeautyRest air beds in the past 7 years, using them as the mattress over a traditional box springs.

1,Excellent for abuse Survivors,"This book was formerly titled ""Growing Up Gay in a Dysfunctional Family: a Guide for Gay Men Reclaiming Their Lives"". The author goes very indepth in describing the makeup of abusive, homophobic families and the impact it has on a gay child growing up. While I myself did not grow up in this type of environment, I still learned a great deal about my own reactions to outside homophobia and that for years I internalized it and developed negative thinking patterns about myself; etc. I thank the author for writing this book, not only for helping me identify problems I needed to work through, but for helping me realize how to develope the skills needed to self nurture and stop internalizing homophobia. Above all, this book is especially relevant to abuse survivors, it will definitely help you.","This book was formerly titled Growing Up Gay in a Dysfunctional Family a Guide for Gay Men Reclaiming Their Lives.

1,Oil free without powder!,"I don't use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily. So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that's it!

So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that's it! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin. It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle."
1,Comfortable undergarments,"I found the material to be very comfortable all day, switching all my pairs to this brand. Be careful what you wash them with though. I had a pair get tangled up with one of my kid's velvro strap ped bibs in the washer and it cosmetically damaged the fabric in one area.","I found the material to be very comfortable all day, switching all my pairs to this brand.

1,Whitney underrated,"The critics were negative with the series ""Whitney"". I disagree. For me, the characters, and the actors playing them determine how I react to a show. I have to want these people into my life every week. With ""Whitney"", I was won over from the first minute. Whitney is not your typical female sitcom star. She is thinner and not your average beauty, but she is an original, and very likable. Chris D'Elia as her boyfriend is perfect. I could watch him all day, his quirky laugh, his unique voice, and his wry way of reacting to Whitney, combined with his sexy body, make him perfect for a weekly viewing at home. Each episode made me laugh, particularly the episode when Alex""s brother visits. Dan O""Brien as Alex's best friend is lovable as the sidekick. I kept all episodes on my DVR until I had the DVD in my hand. It will never be a #1 show, but I hope it manages to run for years, so I can enjoy these people.","The critics were negative with the series Whitney. I disagree.

1,Bravo!,"Another excellant production of Zeffirelli; color, sets, costumes! Superb! Domingo was absolutely perfect in this role. Mitchell was so beautiful, her voice rich, haunting, poignant. Marton's voice wonderful, though I felt her makeup wasn't quite right and her acting stiff. James Levine, always a joy.","Another excellant production of Zeffirelli color, sets, costumes! Superb!

1,a refeshing change!,"I've been waiting, ever so patiently for this novel, and I was not disapointed!I loved the turn of emotions in Colin as he began to see Penelope in a romantic light after having befriended her for years. Their emotional adventures together was wonderful!It was very refreshing to finally met a heroine that was not the picture of absolute beauty. Let's be honest, most of us woman are not what society depicts as ""perfect"" as many of the heroines in romance novels seem to be. I loved watching her finally see her dreams come true and the man that she's cared for for so many years finally return her love, and to hell with looking perfect! It was great.Thanks Julia for another wonderful adventure!!","I've been waiting, ever so patiently for this novel, and I was not disapointed!I loved the turn of emotions in Colin as he began to see Penelope in a romantic light after having befriended her for years.

1,An excellent CD,"Personally, I would recommend that you read Lion's Blood while listening to this CD. Musically, I think it's wonderful, but it's also important to understand the music in the context in which it was written: a world where Celtic and Frankish people are stolen from their homelands to work as slaves in an America settled by Africans. The songs show that mix, of hanging on to a Celtic heritage while unable to keep the Arabic, Islamic, and African forces from penetrating. Heather's music is moving, beautiful, and the perfect companion to the book. Seeing words on paper is one thing, hearing the melodies, the voices of lament, longing, and beauty singing them is quite another.","Personally, I would recommend that you read Lion's Blood while listening to this CD.

1,Another Bang up job from Bang on a Can composers!,"SO Percussion ensemble is a hot young New York percussion group with an exploring sensibility and plenty of chops. The works included here are by two of the composers closely associated with the Bang on a Can Festival, Evan Ziporyn and David Lang. Ziporyn's ""Melody Competition"" evokes elements I associate with some of the music of Bali, not surprising considering that Ziporyn directs a Balinese gamelan ensemble at MIT. Lang's ""So-Called Laws of Nature"" is slightly more ambitious, evolving in three movements for different instrumental combinations. I like the 2nd movement, where bell sounds eventually evolve into drums, and the 3rd movement, that sounds like the joyful romping of children in a mound of broken glass. It's been a long time since a recording label produced such consistently excellent stuff. Thanks, Cantelope, for another beauty!","SO Percussion ensemble is a hot young New York percussion group with an exploring sensibility and plenty of chops.

0,The honest truth...,"My main issue with this item is the fact that the sockets for plugging items in are not straight, not only does this make it very difficult to actually plug an item in it has rendered two of the sockets on mine unusable because it was so out of line nothing could actually go in. Other than that like many Monster items though it may look nice and powerful, that is purely cosmetic, it is very over priced for what it is. I have not had any issues with the operation of the device other than the unusable sockets but there are many significantly cheaper devices that would have been better.","My main issue with this item is the fact that the sockets for plugging items in are not straight, not only does this make it very difficult to actually plug an item in it has rendered two of the sockets on mine unusable because it was so out of line nothing could actually go in.

1,Feels like a transition album,"It would be very hard for anyone to top 1997's ""A Pleasant Shade of Grey."" Fates Warning didn't quite manage it with this one. The album has its moments and is a solid effort from a truly amazing band, but it fails to reach the heights of APSOG, Perfect Symmetry, and No Exit.There are a lot of atmospherics and hints of electronic soundscapes, which began on the last album and are evident a bit more here. My feeling is that by the next album they'll have gotten a better handle on this sort of thing and be able to explore it more thoroughly and again achieve that particular surpassing beauty that no else can deliver.But this album gets 4 stars just for ""Something from Nothing.""","It would be very hard for anyone to top 1997's A Pleasant Shade of Grey.

1,EXCELLENT FIGURE FROM THE FIRST LINE OF AOTC TOYS!,"With the ever increasing attention to detail that the people at Hasbro are putting into their action figures it is of no surprise that this figure looks so great.Padme is even detailed with her distinguishable beauty spot! However Hasbro hasn't yet attained the same quality of detail as, say, MacFarlane Toys but MacFarlane Toys do not deal with the issue of quantity.The little ""action"" actions the Attack of the Clones figures can perform is welcomed as they do not interfere with toy-play.One downside to the toy however is the fact that when Padme's arms are straightened her shoulders look like a Pro Athlete's (slight exaggeration). A minor flaw to a great figure.The ""break-away"" pillar proved to be a few moments worth of fun also.A vital figure to own in the series, especially if you wish to re-enact the Arena Battle on Geonosis.This will definatalie be a great seller (and not only because it is a female character toy).","With the ever increasing attention to detail that the people at Hasbro are putting into their action figures it is of no surprise that this figure looks so great.Padme is even detailed with her distinguishable beauty spot!

0,Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars),"functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible. Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer? I just don't understand proprietary third party software. I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive. That alone makes it not worth buying. Stick with players that are open source. As for the authorization thing to get files off the player? I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.

1,Let it bleed,"What can you say about Garbage that has not been said before? Their rage and power were the heart of what was the mid to late nineties. Comprised of electronica, goth, and punk, Butch Vig and Duke Erikson created this super-strength goliath that will always be legendary. Shirley Manson is the ultimate female singer. She has the beauty of Debrah Harry, the attitude of Patti Smith, the writing ability of Chrisie Hynde, and the soulfulness of Annie Lennox. Gwen Stefani can't touch her with a ten foot pole.This album marks their I guess you can say their rebirth because like with all bands there were problems. The problems were going to end the band but their love for their music resolved that.The songs are similar to what they have released in the past. Songs like ""Why do you love me?"" deals with Shirley's break up with her husband. Eventhough my personal favorite album is 2.0, this album will soon be a classic as well.","What can you say about Garbage that has not been said before?

0,WARNING: This product contains PARABENS and is a cancer risk!,"I work outdoors year round and have used this product for many years because it works wonders on cracked hands. A friend of mine noticed me using this hand cream and warned me that it contains PARABENS which have been linked to various types of cancer including breast cancer. I have since learned that Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream contains not just one but two different types of Parabens. I researched and found that PARABENS are a chemical that mimics estrogen. Furthermore, Parabens are found in many lotions and cosmetics as well as food products. Men who read up on Parabens will never go near them again because PARABENS can shrink testcles and damage male libido. I will never use this product again. In my opinion, this product should be banned. Don't take my word or anyone elses word for it, do your own research, become informed and then make your own judgement. I for one am done with this stuff.","I work outdoors year round and have used this product for many years because it works wonders on cracked hands.

1,Best recording of the Brandenburg Concertos ever!,"After listening to many recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos this is my favorite. It manages to combine the discipline and order required for performing Baroque music with the passion and beauty that is also vital to that period's music.

A fantastic recording, I cannot imagine that there is a better one.","After listening to many recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos this is my favorite.

1,Jose Cura the Dramatic Tenor,"Dramatic looks, dramatic voice,Jose Cura is the new star in the list of tenors who can cope with the dangers of Puccini.Cura copes with the loud and dense orchestrations which can constitute a danger to less talented singers.In this recording ,sympathetically conducted by Placido Domingo,we are shown that this talent will endure. All tenors,with the exception of Carreras love Cavaradossi and Cura's Recondita Armonia is beautiful and emotion packed,with precision and subtle breath control. As des Grieux in Manon Lescaut his mature style is shown to perfection,the voice in full bloom recklessly pouring out the melody of Puccini which we do not find in his later operas, where economy becomes his guiding principle. Few tenors would have the confidence or ability to sing Nessum Dorma as his first aria,but Cura's charisma and vocal beauty shine through. A very sophisticated and musical recording, from a consumate artist of whom we will hear seducing us for a long time.","Dramatic looks, dramatic voice,Jose Cura is the new star in the list of tenors who can cope with the dangers of Puccini.Cura copes with the loud and dense orchestrations which can constitute a danger to less talented singers.In this recording ,sympathetically conducted by Placido Domingo,we are shown that this talent will endure.

1,Tuneful collection of short pieces (easy to intermediate),"Interesting collection of pieces from the 18th-19th centuries, 1/2 page to 2 pages long, which are presented in their original form with only cosmetic editing (no dumbing down/blandizing).Includes lots of well known pieces like a Mendelsson Song Without Words, Tchaikowsky's The Doll's Funeral March, a Mazurka and a Waltz by Chopin, John Blow's Air, a Brahms Waltz, and lots of pieces by well known composers like three of the Bach family, Beethoven, Handel, Hayden, Liszt, Mozart, Schumann and Schubert (also numerous others which are less well known). Probably about half or more of the pieces are ones that I haven't come across before - good for sight reading practice and a bit of variety.An excellent book for beginners in particular, with lots of things of varying difficulty that will keep you busy for a while and give you a taste of lots of composers.","Interesting collection of pieces from the 18th-19th centuries, 12 page to 2 pages long, which are presented in their original form with only cosmetic editing no dumbing downblandizing.Includes lots of well known pieces like a Mendelsson Song Without Words, Tchaikowsky's The Doll's Funeral March, a Mazurka and a Waltz by Chopin, John Blow's Air, a Brahms Waltz, and lots of pieces by well known composers like three of the Bach family, Beethoven, Handel, Hayden, Liszt, Mozart, Schumann and Schubert also numerous others which are less well known.

1,Rock Concert Library? A MUST!!,"I was fortunate enough to find out ahead of time and see this concert. As a big Collective Soul fan, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see them with a symphony. THIS IS A GREAT CONCERT!!! I am not normally big on concerts on video, though I have several friends who do. I've seen most of theirs and they just don't compare. Collective Soul has great music and with these AMAZINGLY talented kids their music SOARS! The songs have such an added dynamic feel to them. THE ENERGY WITH THE ROCK and then the beauty with the ballads.....It's just so much MORE! The crowd feeding off of the energy and sending waves of it back! The behind the scenes with these wonderfully talented kids and the guys mingling and working together. This is definitely one NOT to pass up. Check it out and do yourself a favor and get the CD as well to blast out in your car! ;o)","I was fortunate enough to find out ahead of time and see this concert.

0,Leaks,"I bought this along with the salmon oil for my dogs. I had to cut the hose to fit the bottle which was fine. However, this pump leaks. I tried my best with it even by pulling the top up a little, but no good, oil drips out all over my counter. I have to keep something underneath it now until this salmon oil is used up. Waste of money. This came from a beauty shop according to the label on the bag so it is obviously used for hair products.","I bought this along with the salmon oil for my dogs.

1,A big thank you to Ella and her sister!,"I bought the Bvlgari Aqua Spray, for my husband, after reading about it in Janet Evanovich's ""Ten Big Ones"". Boy does it deliver. The spray and shower gel are now a yearly ritual. It is so rare to find a product that he can use and like, that also PLEASES me! I, sometimes, spray a bit on a wash cloth and put it in our towel closet or spray a bit on a pillow case, to be enclosed with our spare bedding. This is personal care product, that has traveled the world, with him.","I bought the Bvlgari Aqua Spray, for my husband, after reading about it in Janet Evanovich's Ten Big Ones. Boy does it deliver.

1,At Long LAST!!! A Treasure Unearthed!!!,"While this album was shelved some years ago by Poco's label, the fans had begged and pleaded for it's release. Well the wait is over!

1,Departures(the movie),"A Haiku formed as a movie.This movie is so full of life; learning, facing your fears, abandonment, joy, love, sadness, endings and in the big picture life.It is a poem expressed wiih a movie.The music is so beautiful,It is a journey into a poetic realm.A journey expressed in writing, pictures and sound.The acting is close to real life, away from hollywood looks, talks and artificiality.For many, this movie is in a different language, showing a different culture and a different approach to death but it is the universal language of beauty and humanness.If this movie was expressed through a stone letter; it would be an ordinary yet magnificent and beautiful stone. A stone that expresses roughness, smoothness, grief, joy, strength, pain, accepting and letting go.It is like holding your own stone, facing the ocean and going on a journey that is through death that leads to life","A Haiku formed as a movie.This movie is so full of life learning, facing your fears, abandonment, joy, love, sadness, endings and in the big picture life.It is a poem expressed wiih a movie.The music is so beautiful,It is a journey into a poetic realm.A journey expressed in writing, pictures and sound.The acting is close to real life, away from hollywood looks, talks and artificiality.For many, this movie is in a different language, showing a different culture and a different approach to death but it is the universal language of beauty and humanness.If this movie was expressed through a stone letter it would be an ordinary yet magnificent and beautiful stone.

1,Easy on your skin and removes make up easily.,"I first found these at Trader Joe's and picked them up on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they removed my makeup and left my skin feeling clean and cared for and have often followed with moisturizer after a long day at work so I could at least get my makeup off before I went to bed. Of course, for days that I have more time and energy I can follow with my normal cleansing routine.I've tried a few other brands but have always returned to Comodyne's as the other brands would start to irritate my skin even in a weeks time and I've never experienced any irritation with Comodyne's.I ordered the 3-pack this time, but will order the 6-pack next time for the value and would definitely buy it through the Subscribe & Save program if it were offered.","I first found these at Trader Joe's and picked them up on a whim.

1,pretty good,"works well for shaping eyebrows etc., but you had better have a steady hand. They don't last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year. I consider it a must in my beauty kit.","works well for shaping eyebrows etc., but you had better have a steady hand. They don't last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year.

1,Eye Sun Protection.. Love it,Works great at protecting my skin from the sun and makes my makeup go on very smoothly.

1,100%...GUARANTEED!,"I bought Trish's DVD Sept 23rd, and I have to say that it was amazing. Knowing in advance that she has helped produce this, not only gave me a more personal view of her, but yet shows her intelligence even more.Although the DVD did not share with us a lot of stuff we didn't already know about Trish, some things were meant to stay personal. It did, however, give a WONDERFUL insight on her life and career; the road to becoming the woman she is today.A lot of candid footage throughout the DVD was all in all more of a bonus. It not only portrayed Trish's beauty, but her personality; goofy-ness.I strongly suggest any Trish fan buy this DVD. If you are even a major wrestling fan, I think this is a great DVD to see one of the top divas in wrestling.","I bought Trish's DVD Sept 23rd, and I have to say that it was amazing.

0,Junk Mirror don't buy,"I purchased 2 of these makeup mirrors for my two daughters for Christmas. This is now 9 months later and both of them quit working, thinking that maybe they both had light bulbs go out the same weekend, so looked for them, but they sell the mirror and bulbs for all the other mirrors, but not for this one. It sure is strange that they both stopped working after nine months. Wonder if that was planned by the manufacturer, to sell more mirrors? I will be purchasing 2 more but not this kind, ever again. I could not rate this low enough.","I purchased 2 of these makeup mirrors for my two daughters for Christmas.

1,Great Mirror !! Great Illumination!!,"I had owned a mirror for a couple of years just like this. Same style. Same Company, Jerdon. Well one day it just died. We would leave that thing on for hours at a time some nights. Lasted through many hours daily. So I decided to buy the same one again. It came in the mail and the only difference was the light switch. I used to have to hold mine down till the lights came on. The new one just goes on with one flip . That was great. The bad thing was it started blinking the first day. So Amazon sent me a new one. We have had the new one for some time now and it is great. The other one was a lemon. This one is perfect. I would never get a different one because the lights on this are very bright which i need when applying my eye makeup. My husband even uses it to cut his mustache!!! I would highly recommend this mirror, and would definitely by this brand again.","I had owned a mirror for a couple of years just like this. Same style. Same Company, Jerdon.

0,Needs To Be Better Researched,"Seems to be a reworking of earlier books like Arthur Marwick's book BEAUTY IN HISTORY. To assume that art isa representation of beauty of it's time is for future people to think we valued Picasso's notions of ideal form in his abstract depictions of women. Just as people falsely assume Ruben was painting beautiful women, he was doing nothing of the sort. His journals contain amble notes about how he preferred the male form. Sometimes art is just an expression or an exercise in politics, skill and who is paying the bill.","Seems to be a reworking of earlier books like Arthur Marwick's book BEAUTY IN HISTORY.

1,Good Product Overall,"Hung this in our bathroom for my wife to use for makeup. She loves it. It was easy to install and came with all the appropriate hardware. It has nice looking looking brushed satin nickel finish. I would note that is has short arm, which was appropriate for the location where it was mounted in my home but please take note of the dimensions when considering where you would place it. Overall, very satisfied.","Hung this in our bathroom for my wife to use for makeup. She loves it. It was easy to install and came with all the appropriate hardware.

1,EXCELLENT reading in the BEAUTY SHOP!!!,"Blessings!!! Blessings!!! Blessings!!! I started to read this book while I was in the BEAUTY SHOP. I get my hair down weekly so this was the only time I had to read. I must say, reading Blessings while in a Beauty Shop makes the reading much more entertaining. There are 4 women in the shop at Blessings and there are 4 women at the shop where I get my hair done. The personality of Pat, Faye, Zuma and Sandy fit the personalities of the Stylists' at the salon. It was amazing...sad..funny all at the same time. The only bad point in the book was Sandy - and her lost. The question, ""why does it take so LONG in the beauty shop?"" My answer, I'm glad it does, I was able to finish the book in 3 appointments!!!!","Blessings!!! Blessings!!! Blessings!!! I started to read this book while I was in the BEAUTY SHOP.

1,Let's go to Nordland!,"I am a new fan of Bathory. This was the first Bathory album that I purchased. I listened to the sound clips and they sounded pretty cool so I decided to get the CD. When I listened to the Cd for the first time I was just BLOWN AWAY! I have never heard anything with so much power and beauty as this CD other than the greatest band ever(DEATH). This CD is full of memorable guitar riffs and vocals. The whole album is perfect, every song is great. I recommend this album to anyone who listens to real metal.","I am a new fan of Bathory.

1,listening for years,"These are masterpieces of the literature. Few 20th centurystring quartets are full of light. These are. The reviewer below (above) from Australia who mentions ""atonal""is as far off the mark as one could get. These are supremely tonal pieces, in fact very conservatively so. In fact,there is not an atonal moment in them, they are more firmly rooted in tonal centers than even Bartok, Hindemith and Ravel quartets of the early part of the century. The comments about small fragments are correct however. These are mosaic structures of great beauty. Other quartets which are crafted similarly are those by Stravinsky. Imagine a more Slavic flavor and you have Janacek.","These are masterpieces of the literature. Few 20th centurystring quartets are full of light. These are.

0,Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this Product,"After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. I have never had a reaction like this otherwise. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands that do not contain it.","After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days.

1,We waited and requested for 2 long years. Finally.,"This is by far the best ever Beauty and the Beast ever written. I bought it years ago and have my hard copy still. When my vision got worse, luckily the Kindle was created and my problem was solved- except that I missed some of my old friends. Then the folks at Amazon added a place where you can (with a click) ask an author to permit a kindle copy. My daughters and I wanted this on Kindle--- We asked repeatedly -- at least every 2 months from all three of us. We prevailed. YAY.","This is by far the best ever Beauty and the Beast ever written.

0,Not one of their best DVDs,"I was a bit disappointed with this new release. The beach background and the music were distracting and the exercises were not as well designed as in their other DVDs. I am a fan of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh. A month after I started the Fat Free Yoga DVD, I withdrew my gym membership and did yoga only. I own several of their DVDs and I rotate them in the course of a week. Overall, I feel healthier, happier, sleep better, and I even like myself better. My favorite DVDs are Lose Weight & Feel Great, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Cleanse.","I was a bit disappointed with this new release.
